815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the eleven years that separated the Declaration of the Independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the United States from the completion of that act in the ordination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of our written Constitution, the great minds of America were bent upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the study of the principles of government that were essential to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preservation of the liberties which had been won at great cost and with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,heroic labors and sacrifices. Their studies were conducted in view of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the imperfections that experience had developed in the government of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Confederation, and they were, therefore, practical and thorough.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the Constitution was thus perfected and established, a new form of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government was created, but it was neither speculative nor experimental","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as to the principles on which it was based. If they were true,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles, as they were, the government founded upon them was destined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to a life and an influence that would continue while the liberties it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was intended to preserve should be valued by the human family. Those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberties had been wrung from reluctant monarchs in many contests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in many countries, and were grouped into creeds and established in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ordinances sealed with blood, in many great struggles of the people.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They were not new to the people. They were consecrated theories, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no government had been previously established for the great purpose of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their preservation and enforcement. That which was experimental in our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,plan of government was the question whether democratic rule could be so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,organized and conducted that it would not degenerate into license and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"result in the tyranny of absolutism, without saving to the people the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power so often found necessary of repressing or destroying their enemy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when he was found in the person of a single despot.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When, in 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville came to study Democracy in America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the trial of nearly a half-century of the working of our system had been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"made, and it had been proved, by many crucial tests, to be a government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of ""liberty regulated by law,"" with such results in the development of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"strength, in population, wealth, and military and commercial power, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no age had ever witnessed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[See Alexis De Tocqueville],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"De Tocqueville had a special inquiry to prosecute, in his visit to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, in which his generous and faithful soul and the powers of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great intellect were engaged in the patriotic effort to secure to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people of France the blessings that Democracy in America had ordained,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and established throughout nearly the entire Western Hemisphere. He had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"read the story of the French Revolution, much of which had been recently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,written in the blood of men and women of great distinction who were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his progenitors; and had witnessed the agitations and terrors of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Restoration and of the Second Republic, fruitful in crime and sacrifice,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and barren of any good to mankind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He had just witnessed the spread of republican government through all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the vast continental possessions of Spain in America, and the loss of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,her great colonies. He had seen that these revolutions were accomplished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"almost without the shedding of blood, and he was filled with anxiety to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"learn the causes that had placed republican government, in France, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,such contrast with Democracy in America.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,De Tocqueville was scarcely thirty years old when he began his studies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Democracy in America. It was a bold effort for one who had no special,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"training in government, or in the study of political economy, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had the example of Lafayette in establishing the military foundation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these liberties, and of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all of whom were young men, in building upon the Independence of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States that wisest and best plan of general government that was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ever devised for a free people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"He found that the American people, through their chosen representatives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who were instructed by their wisdom and experience and were supported,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by their virtues--cultivated, purified and ennobled by self-reliance and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the love of God--had matured, in the excellent wisdom of their counsels,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a new plan of government, which embraced every security for their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberties and equal rights and privileges to all in the pursuit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,happiness. He came as an honest and impartial student and his great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commentary, like those of Paul, was written for the benefit of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations and people and in vindication of truths that will stand for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their deliverance from monarchical rule, while time shall last.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A French aristocrat of the purest strain of blood and of the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"honorable lineage, whose family influence was coveted by crowned heads;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who had no quarrel with the rulers of the nation, and was secure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,against want by his inherited estates; was moved by the agitations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that compelled France to attempt to grasp suddenly the liberties and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happiness we had gained in our revolution and, by his devout love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of France, to search out and subject to the test of reason the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,basic principles of free government that had been embodied in our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution. This was the mission of De Tocqueville, and no mission","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was ever more honorably or justly conducted, or concluded with greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eclat, or better results for the welfare of mankind.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,His researches were logical and exhaustive. They included every phase of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every question that then seemed to be apposite to the great inquiry he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was making.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The judgment of all who have studied his commentaries seems to have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unanimous, that his talents and learning were fully equal to his task.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"He began with the physical geography of this country, and examined the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"characteristics of the people, of all races and conditions, their social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and religious sentiments, their education and tastes; their industries,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their commerce, their local governments, their passions and prejudices,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and their ethics and literature; leaving nothing unnoticed that might,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,afford an argument to prove that our plan and form of government was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or was not adapted especially to a peculiar people, or that it would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impracticable in any different country, or among any different people.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The pride and comfort that the American people enjoy in the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commentaries of De Tocqueville are far removed from the selfish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adulation that comes from a great and singular success. It is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consciousness of victory over a false theory of government which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"afflicted mankind for many ages, that gives joy to the true American, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it did to De Tocqueville in his great triumph.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When De Tocqueville wrote, we had lived less than fifty years under our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution. In that time no great national commotion had occurred that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tested its strength, or its power of resistance to internal strife, such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as had converted his beloved France into fields of slaughter torn by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tempests of wrath.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He had a strong conviction that no government could be ordained that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"could resist these internal forces, when, they are directed to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"destruction by bad men, or unreasoning mobs, and many then believed, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some yet believe, that our government is unequal to such pressure, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the assault is thoroughly desperate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Had De Tocqueville lived to examine the history of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from 1860 to 1870, his misgivings as to this power of self-preservation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"would, probably, have been cleared off. He would have seen that, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the end of the most destructive civil war that ever occurred, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,animosities of the bitterest sort had banished all good feeling from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the hearts of our people, the States of the American Union, still in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"complete organization and equipped with all their official entourage,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aligned themselves in their places and took up the powers and duties of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,local government in perfect order and without embarrassment. This would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have dispelled his apprehensions, if he had any, about the power of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States to withstand the severest shocks of civil war. Could he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have traced the further course of events until they open the portals of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the twentieth century, he would have cast away his fears of our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ability to restore peace, order, and prosperity, in the face of any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"difficulties, and would have rejoiced to find in the Constitution of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States the remedy that is provided for the healing of the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"De Tocqueville examined, with the care that is worthy the importance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the subject, the nature and value of the system of ""local","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"self-government,"" as we style this most important feature of our plan,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and (as has often happened) when this or any subject has become a matter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of anxious concern, his treatment of the questions is found to have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,masterly and his preconceptions almost prophetic.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,We are frequently indebted to him for able expositions and true,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,doctrines relating to subjects that have slumbered in the minds of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people until they were suddenly forced on our attention by unexpected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,events.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In his introductory chapter, M. De Tocqueville says: ""Amongst the novel","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conditions."" He referred, doubtless, to social and political conditions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"among the people of the white race, who are described as ""We, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people,"" in the opening sentence of the Constitution. The last three","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amendments of the Constitution have so changed this, that those who were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then negro slaves are clothed with the rights of citizenship, including","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the right of suffrage. This was a political party movement, intended to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be radical and revolutionary, but it will, ultimately, react because it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has not the sanction of public opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If M. De Tocqueville could now search for a law that would negative this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provision in its effect upon social equality, he would fail to find it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But he would find it in the unwritten law of the natural aversion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"races. He would find it in public opinion, which is the vital force in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every law in a free government. This is a subject that our Constitution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"failed to regulate, because it was not contemplated by its authors. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is a question that will settle itself, without serious difficulty. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equality in the suffrage, thus guaranteed to the negro race, alone--for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it was not intended to include other colored races--creates a new phase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of political conditions that M. De Tocqueville could not foresee.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Yet, in his commendation of the local town and county governments,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he applauds and sustains that elementary feature of our political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"organization which, in the end, will render harmless this wide departure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the original plan and purpose of American Democracy. ""Local","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Self-Government,"" independent of general control, except for general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purposes, is the root and origin of all free republican government, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is the antagonist of all great political combinations that threaten the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rights of minorities. It is the public opinion formed in the independent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expressions of towns and other small civil districts that is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,real conservatism of free government. It is equally the enemy of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dangerous evil, the corruption of the ballot-box, from which it is now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,apprehended that one of our greatest troubles is to arise.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The voter is selected, under our laws, because he has certain physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"qualifications--age and sex. His disqualifications, when any are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imposed, relate to his education or property, and to the fact that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has not been convicted of crime. Of all men he should be most directly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amenable to public opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The test of moral character and devotion to the duties of good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizenship are ignored in the laws, because the courts can seldom deal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with such questions in a uniform and satisfactory way, under rules that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"apply alike to all. Thus the voter, selected by law to represent himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and four other non-voting citizens, is often a person who is unfit for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"any public duty or trust. In a town government, having a small area of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"jurisdiction, where the voice of the majority of qualified voters is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conclusive, the fitness of the person who is to exercise that high","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representative privilege can be determined by his neighbors and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquaintances, and, in the great majority of cases, it will be decided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"honestly and for the good of the country. In such meetings, there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"always a spirit of loyalty to the State, because that is loyalty to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people, and a reverence for God that gives weight to the duties and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsibilities of citizenship.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,M. De Tocqueville found in these minor local jurisdictions the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"theoretical conservatism which, in the aggregate, is the safest reliance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the State. So we have found them, in practice, the true protectors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the purity of the ballot, without which all free government will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,degenerate into absolutism.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the future of the Republic, we must encounter many difficult and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dangerous situations, but the principles established in the Constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the check upon hasty or inconsiderate legislation, and upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"executive action, and the supreme arbitrament of the courts, will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"found sufficient for the safety of personal rights, and for the safety","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the government, and the prophetic outlook of M. De Tocqueville will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be fully realized through the influence of Democracy in America. Each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,succeeding generation of Americans will find in the pure and impartial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reflections of De Tocqueville a new source of pride in our institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of government, and sound reasons for patriotic effort to preserve","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them and to inculcate their teachings. They have mastered the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarchical rule in the American Hemisphere, freeing religion from all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shackles, and will spread, by a quiet but resistless influence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"through the islands of the seas to other lands, where the appeals of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,De Tocqueville for human rights and liberties have already inspired the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,souls of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Nearly two-thirds of a century has elapsed since the appearance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""Democracy in America,"" by Alexis Charles Henri Clerel de Tocqueville, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"French nobleman, born at Paris, July 29, 1805.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Bred to the law, he exhibited an early predilection for philosophy and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political economy, and at twenty-two was appointed judge-auditor at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In 1831, commissioned ostensibly to investigate the penitentiary system","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the United States, he visited this country, with his friend, Gustave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"de Beaumont, travelling extensively through those parts of the Republic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then subdued to settlement, studying the methods of local, State, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"""Democracy in America,"" the first of four volumes upon ""American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Institutions and their Influence,"" was published in 1835. It was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"received at once by the scholars and thinkers of Europe as a profound,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impartial, and entertaining exposition of the principles of popular,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representative self-government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Napoleon, ""The mighty somnambulist of a vanished dream,"" had abolished","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feudalism and absolutism, made monarchs and dynasties obsolete, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,substituted for the divine right of kings the sovereignty of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Although by birth and sympathies an aristocrat, M. de Tocqueville","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,saw that the reign of tradition and privilege at last was ended. He,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perceived that civilization, after many bloody centuries, had entered a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"new epoch. He beheld, and deplored, the excesses that had attended the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"genesis of the democratic spirit in France, and while he loved liberty,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he detested the crimes that had been committed in its name. Belonging,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,neither to the class which regarded the social revolution as an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"innovation to be resisted, nor to that which considered political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equality the universal panacea for the evils of humanity, he resolved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by personal observation of the results of democracy in the New World,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to ascertain its natural consequences, and to learn what the nations of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europe had to hope or fear from its final supremacy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,That a youth of twenty-six should entertain a design so broad and bold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,implies singular intellectual intrepidity. He had neither model,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nor precedent. The vastness and novelty of the undertaking increase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,admiration for the remarkable ability with which the task was performed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Were literary excellence the sole claim of ""Democracy in America"" to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinction, the splendor of its composition alone would entitle it to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"high place among the masterpieces of the century. The first chapter,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon the exterior form of North America, as the theatre upon which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great drama is to be enacted, for graphic and picturesque description","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the physical characteristics of the continent is not surpassed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in literature: nor is there any subdivision of the work in which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"severest philosophy is not invested with the grace of poetry, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,driest statistics with the charm of romance. Western emigration seemed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commonplace and prosaic till M. de Tocqueville said, ""This gradual and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,continuous progress of the European race toward the Rocky Mountains has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unabatedly, and daily driven onward by the hand of God!""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The mind of M. de Tocqueville had the candor of the photographic camera.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It recorded impressions with the impartiality of nature. The image was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sometimes distorted, and the perspective was not always true, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was neither a panegyrist, nor an advocate, nor a critic. He observed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American phenomena as illustrations, not as proof nor arguments; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Introductory Chapter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,equality of conditions. I readily discovered the prodigious influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"giving a certain direction to public opinion, and a certain tenor to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the laws; by imparting new maxims to the governing powers, and peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,habits to the governed. I speedily perceived that the influence of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fact extends far beyond the political character and the laws of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, and that it has no less empire over civil society than over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Government; it creates opinions, engenders sentiments, suggests the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ordinary practices of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The more I advanced in the study of American society, the more I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,my observations constantly terminated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,presented to me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,progressing towards those extreme limits which it seems to have reached,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the United States, and that the democracy which governs the American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,communities appears to be rapidly rising into power in Europe. I hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conceived the idea of the book which is now before the reader.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,going on amongst us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences. To some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may still be checked; to others it seems irresistible, because it is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most uniform, the most ancient, and the most permanent tendency which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be found in history. Let us recollect the situation of France seven,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hundred years ago, when the territory was divided amongst a small number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of families, who were the owners of the soil and the rulers of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the inhabitants; the right of governing descended with the family,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inheritance from generation to generation; force was the only means by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which man could act on man, and landed property was the sole source of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power. Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"began to exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the poor and the rich, the villein and the lord; equality penetrated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"into the Government through the Church, and the being who as a serf must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have vegetated in perpetual bondage took his place as a priest in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"midst of nobles, and not infrequently above the heads of kings.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The different relations of men became more complicated and more numerous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as society gradually became more stable and more civilized. Thence the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,want of civil laws was felt; and the order of legal functionaries soon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rose from the obscurity of the tribunals and their dusty chambers, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appear at the court of the monarch, by the side of the feudal barons in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their ermine and their mail. Whilst the kings were ruining themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by their great enterprises, and the nobles exhausting their resources","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by private wars, the lower orders were enriching themselves by commerce.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The influence of money began to be perceptible in State affairs. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"transactions of business opened a new road to power, and the financier","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rose to a station of political influence in which he was at once,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"flattered and despised. Gradually the spread of mental acquirements, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the increasing taste for literature and art, opened chances of success","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to talent; science became a means of government, intelligence led to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"social power, and the man of letters took a part in the affairs of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State. The value attached to the privileges of birth decreased in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exact proportion in which new paths were struck out to advancement. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the eleventh century nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it might be purchased; it was conferred for the first time in 1270;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and equality was thus introduced into the Government by the aristocracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order to resist the authority of the Crown, or to diminish the power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their rivals, the nobles granted a certain share of political rights to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people. Or, more frequently, the king permitted the lower orders","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to enjoy a degree of power, with the intention of repressing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy. In France the kings have always been the most active and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most constant of levellers. When they were strong and ambitious they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spared no pains to raise the people to the level of the nobles; when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they were temperate or weak they allowed the people to rise above,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves. Some assisted the democracy by their talents, others by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"throne to the same subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Court, into the dust.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"personal property began in its turn to confer influence and power, every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,improvement which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a fresh,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"element of the equality of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every new want which it engendered, and every new desire which craved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"satisfaction, was a step towards the universal level. The taste for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"luxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, and the most superficial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as well as the deepest passions of the human heart, co-operated to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enrich the poor and to impoverish the rich.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,From the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"strength and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to science, every fresh truth, and every new idea as a germ of power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"placed within the reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the grace of wit, the glow of imagination, the depth of thought, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the gifts which are bestowed by Providence with an equal hand, turned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the advantage of the democracy; and even when they were in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of its adversaries they still served its cause by throwing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"into relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests spread,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, with those of civilization and knowledge, and literature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,became an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could always find,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weapons to their hand.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"single great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,turned to the advantage of equality. The Crusades and the wars of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,English decimated the nobles and divided their possessions; the erection,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of communities introduced an element of democratic liberty into the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bosom of feudal monarchy; the invention of fire-arms equalized the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,villein and the noble on the field of battle; printing opened the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resources to the minds of all classes; the post was organized so as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bring the same information to the door of the poor man's cottage and to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the gate of the palace; and Protestantism proclaimed that all men are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alike able to find the road to heaven. The discovery of America offered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a thousand new paths to fortune, and placed riches and power within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the reach of the adventurous and the obscure. If we examine what has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happened in France at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eleventh century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold revolution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has taken place in the state of society. The noble has gone down on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"social ladder, and the roturier has gone up; the one descends as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other rises. Every half century brings them nearer to each other, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they will very shortly meet.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,our eyes we shall witness the same continual revolution throughout the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whole of Christendom. The various occurrences of national existence have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,everywhere turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have aided it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by their exertions: those who have intentionally labored in its cause,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and those who have served it unwittingly; those who have fought for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it and those who have declared themselves its opponents, have all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been driven along in the same track, have all labored to one end, some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been blind instruments in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hands of God.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The gradual development of the equality of conditions is therefore a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"providential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interference, and all events as well as all men contribute to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"progress. Would it, then, be wise to imagine that a social impulse which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dates from so far back can be checked by the efforts of a generation? Is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it credible that the democracy which has annihilated the feudal system,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and vanquished kings will respect the citizen and the capitalist? Will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it stop now that it has grown so strong and its adversaries so weak?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"None can say which way we are going, for all terms of comparison are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the Christian,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,countries of the present day than it has been at any time or in any part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the world; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreseeing what may be yet to come.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The whole book which is here offered to the public has been written,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,under the impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"author's mind by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not necessary that God himself should speak in order to disclose to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,us the unquestionable signs of His will; we can discern them in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency of events: I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"know, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the orbits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traced by the Creator's finger. If the men of our time were led by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gradual and progressive development of social equality is at once the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"past and future of their history, this solitary truth would confer the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sacred character of a Divine decree upon the change. To attempt to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,check democracy would be in that case to resist the will of God; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nations would then be constrained to make the best of the social lot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,awarded to them by Providence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cannot be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their fate is in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,longer. The first duty which is at this time imposed upon those who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"direct our affairs is to educate the democracy; to warm its faith,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if that be possible; to purify its morals; to direct its energies;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to substitute a knowledge of business for its inexperience, and an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquaintance with its true interests for its blind propensities; to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adapt its government to time and place, and to modify it in compliance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the occurrences and the actors of the age. A new science of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"politics is indispensable to a new world. This, however, is what we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"think of least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we obstinately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fix our eyes on the ruins which may still be described upon the shore we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have left, whilst the current sweeps us along, and drives us backwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,towards the gulf.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been describing made such rapid progress as in France; but it has always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been borne on by chance. The heads of the State have never had any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forethought for its exigencies, and its victories have been obtained","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without their consent or without their knowledge. The most powerful, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most intelligent, and the most moral classes of the nation have never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attempted to connect themselves with it in order to guide it. The people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has consequently been abandoned to its wild propensities, and it has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,grown up like those outcasts who receive their education in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the vices and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy was seemingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the supreme power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Everything was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"idol of strength; until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislator conceived the rash project of annihilating its power, instead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of instructing it and correcting its vices; no attempt was made to fit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it to govern, but all were bent on excluding it from the government.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effected only in the material parts of society, without that concomitant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"change in laws, ideas, customs, and manners which was necessary to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"render such a revolution beneficial. We have gotten a democracy, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without the conditions which lessen its vices and render its natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages more prominent; and although we already perceive the evils it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"brings, we are ignorant of the benefits it may confer.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"While the power of the Crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governed the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wretchedness, several different advantages which can now scarcely be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appreciated or conceived. The power of a part of his subjects was an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insurmountable barrier to the tyranny of the prince; and the monarch,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who felt the almost divine character which he enjoyed in the eyes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the multitude, derived a motive for the just use of his power from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"respect which he inspired. High as they were placed above the people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nobles could not but take that calm and benevolent interest in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its fate which the shepherd feels towards his flock; and without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acknowledging the poor as their equals, they watched over the destiny of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those whose welfare Providence had entrusted to their care. The people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,never having conceived the idea of a social condition different from its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own, and entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its chiefs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,received benefits from them without discussing their rights. It grew,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attached to them when they were clement and just, and it submitted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without resistance or servility to their exactions, as to the inevitable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"visitations of the arm of God. Custom, and the manners of the time,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had moreover created a species of law in the midst of violence, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,established certain limits to oppression. As the noble never suspected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that anyone would attempt to deprive him of the privileges which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked upon his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inferiority as a consequence of the immutable order of nature, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,easy to imagine that a mutual exchange of good-will took place between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two classes so differently gifted by fate. Inequality and wretchedness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were then to be found in society; but the souls of neither rank of men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were degraded. Men are not corrupted by the exercise of power or debased,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the habit of obedience, but by the exercise of a power which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,believe to be illegal and by obedience to a rule which they consider,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be usurped and oppressive. On one side was wealth, strength, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"leisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taste, the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On the other was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,labor and a rude ignorance; but in the midst of this coarse and ignorant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"multitude it was not uncommon to meet with energetic passions, generous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sentiments, profound religious convictions, and independent virtues. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"body of a State thus organized might boast of its stability, its power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and, above all, of its glory.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divisions which once severed mankind are lowered, property is divided,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power is held in common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,capacities of all classes are equally cultivated; the State becomes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic, and the empire of democracy is slowly and peaceably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introduced into the institutions and the manners of the nation. I can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conceive a society in which all men would profess an equal attachment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and respect for the laws of which they are the common authors; in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the authority of the State would be respected as necessary, though not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as divine; and the loyalty of the subject to its chief magistrate would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not be a passion, but a quiet and rational persuasion. Every individual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"being in the possession of rights which he is sure to retain, a kind of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manly reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alike removed from pride and meanness. The people, well acquainted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with its true interests, would allow that in order to profit by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages of society it is necessary to satisfy its demands. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state of things the voluntary association of the citizens might supply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the individual exertions of the nobles, and the community would be alike","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protected from anarchy and from oppression.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I admit that, in a democratic State thus constituted, society will not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,directed forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aristocracy, the contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasures of enjoyment may be less excessive, but those of comfort will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be more general; the sciences may be less perfectly cultivated, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ignorance will be less common; the impetuosity of the feelings will be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"repressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vices and fewer crimes. In the absence of enthusiasm and of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ardent faith, great sacrifices may be obtained from the members of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their experience;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,each individual will feel the same necessity for uniting with his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fellow-citizens to protect his own weakness; and as he knows that if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,personal interest is identified with the interest of the community. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perhaps less strong; but the majority of the citizens will enjoy a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"greater degree of prosperity, and the people will remain quiet, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"because it despairs of amelioration, but because it is conscious of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages of its condition. If all the consequences of this state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"things were not good or useful, society would at least have appropriated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all such as were useful and good; and having once and for ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"renounced the social advantages of aristocracy, mankind would enter into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of all the benefits which democracy can afford.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"we have abandoned. The spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,succeeded by the majesty of the laws; the people has learned to despise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all authority, but fear now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that which was formerly paid by reverence and by love.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able to cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the Government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that has inherited the privileges of which families, corporations, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individuals have been deprived; the weakness of the whole community has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore succeeded that influence of a small body of citizens, which,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative. The division","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of property has lessened the distance which separated the rich from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"poor; but it would seem that the nearer they draw to each other, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"greater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement the envy and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dread with which they resist each other's claims to power; the notion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Right is alike insensible to both classes, and Force affords to both the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only argument for the present, and the only guarantee for the future.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"understanding the science which controls it, and his egotism is no less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"blind than his devotedness was formerly. If society is tranquil, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not because it relies upon its strength and its well-being, but because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it knows its weakness and its infirmities; a single effort may cost it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its life; everybody feels the evil, but no one has courage or energy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enough to seek the cure; the desires, the regret, the sorrows, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"joys of the time produce nothing that is visible or permanent, like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions of old men which terminate in impotence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"We have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"afforded, without receiving any compensation from our present condition;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"we have destroyed an aristocracy, and we seem inclined to survey its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ruins with complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The phenomena which the intellectual world presents are not less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deplorable. The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to its lawless passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has shaken all that it has not destroyed. Its empire on society has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not been gradually introduced or peaceably established, but it has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constantly advanced in the midst of disorder and the agitation of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is hurried beyond,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,language which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arises the strange confusion which we are witnessing. I cannot recall to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,my mind a passage in history more worthy of sorrow and of pity than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scenes which are happening under our eyes; it is as if the natural bond,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which unites the opinions of man to his tastes and his actions to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his principles was now broken; the sympathy which has always been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acknowledged between the feelings and the ideas of mankind appears to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to be abolished.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Zealous Christians may be found amongst us whose minds are nurtured in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the love and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the cause of human liberty as the source of all moral greatness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Christianity, which has declared that all men are equal in the sight of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"God, will not refuse to acknowledge that all citizens are equal in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of events, religion is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entangled in those institutions which democracy assails, and it is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to curse that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cause of liberty as a foe which it might hallow by its alliance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,By the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,turned to the earth more than to Heaven; they are the partisans of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty, not only as the source of the noblest virtues, but more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,especially as the root of all solid advantages; and they sincerely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"desire to extend its sway, and to impart its blessings to mankind. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is natural that they should hasten to invoke the assistance of religion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for they must know that liberty cannot be established without morality,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in the ranks of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of them attack it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"openly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavish-minded, whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,struggling without hope to save the liberties of mankind. But men of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"high and generous characters are now to be met with, whose opinions are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at variance with their inclinations, and who praise that servility which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they have themselves never known. Others, on the contrary, speak in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its sanctity and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,always disowned. There are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pure morality, quiet habits, affluence, and talents fit them to be the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,leaders of the surrounding population; their love of their country is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sincere, and they are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"welfare, but they confound the abuses of civilization with its benefits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the idea of evil is inseparable in their minds from that of novelty.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Not far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialize","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to acquire knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from virtue;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assuming the title of the champions of modern civilization, and placing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves in a station which they usurp with insolence, and from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they are driven by their own unworthiness. Where are we then?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The religionists are the enemies of liberty, and the friends of liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attack religion; the high-minded and the noble advocate subjection,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the meanest and most servile minds preach independence; honest and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress, whilst men without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism and without principles are the apostles of civilization and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries which have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"preceded our own? and has man always inhabited a world like the present,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where nothing is linked together, where virtue is without genius, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,genius without honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for oppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt of law;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where the light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or shameful, false or true? I cannot, however, believe that the Creator","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,made man to leave him in an endless struggle with the intellectual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,miseries which surround us: God destines a calmer and a more certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"future to the communities of Europe; I am unacquainted with His designs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but I shall not cease to believe in them because I cannot fathom them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and I had rather mistrust my own capacity than His justice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,speaking of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been effected with ease and simplicity, say rather that this country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has attained the consequences of the democratic revolution which we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are undergoing without having experienced the revolution itself. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,emigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of America in the beginning,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the seventeenth century severed the democratic principle from all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the principles which repressed it in the old communities of Europe, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,transplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there been allowed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its consequences in the laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by influencing the manners of the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It appears to me beyond a doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like the Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,do not conclude from this that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same political consequences which the Americans have derived from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a similar social organization. I am far from supposing that they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chosen the only form of government which a democracy may adopt; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,identity of the efficient cause of laws and manners in the two countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is sufficient to account for the immense interest we have in becoming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquainted with its effects in each of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,examined America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ourselves profit. Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,panegyric will perceive that such was not my design; nor has it been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"my object to advocate any form of government in particular, for I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of opinion that absolute excellence is rarely to be found in any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation; I have not even affected to discuss whether the social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"revolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is advantageous or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prejudicial to mankind; I have acknowledged this revolution as a fact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,already accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"selected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which its development has been the most peaceful and the most complete,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in order to discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable. I confess,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or to hope from its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,progress.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"given to the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to exhibit the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,course it prescribes to the Government and the influence it exercises on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affairs. I have sought to discover the evils and the advantages which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it produces. I have examined the precautions used by the Americans to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"direct it, as well as those which they have not adopted, and I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertaken to point out the causes which enable it to govern society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I do not know whether I have succeeded in making known what I saw in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, but I am certain that such has been my sincere desire, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have never, knowingly, moulded facts to ideas, instead of ideas to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,facts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"approved works. I have cited my authorities in the notes, and anyone may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"refer to them. Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the manners of the country was concerned, I endeavored to consult the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most enlightened men I met with. If the point in question was important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or doubtful, I was not satisfied with one testimony, but I formed my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinion on the evidence of several witnesses. Here the reader must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessarily believe me upon my word. I could frequently have quoted names,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which are either known to him, or which deserve to be so, in proof of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,what I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this practice. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stranger frequently hears important truths at the fire-side of his host,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of friendship;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he consoles himself with his guest for the silence to which he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"restricted, and the shortness of the traveller's stay takes away all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fear of his indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature as soon as it occurred, but these notes will never leave my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,writing-case; I had rather injure the success of my statements than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,add my name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and annoyance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. Those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,readers who may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which connects the several parts together. But the diversity of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subjects I have had to treat is exceedingly great, and it will not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"difficult to oppose an isolated fact to the body of facts which I quote,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or an isolated idea to the body of ideas I put forth. I hope to be read,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my book may be judged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my own judgment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence. It must not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is obliged to push,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences, and often to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sometimes to quit the rules of logic in active life, such is not the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"case in discourse, and a man finds that almost as many difficulties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spring from inconsistency of language as usually arise from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inconsistency of conduct.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the principal defect of the work. This book is written to favor no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"particular views, and in composing it I have entertained no designs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of serving or attacking any party; I have undertaken not to see,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"differently, but to look further than parties, and whilst they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,busied for the morrow I have turned my thoughts to the Future.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Chapter Summary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"North America divided into two vast regions, one inclining towards the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Pole, the other towards the Equator--Valley of the Mississippi--Traces","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Revolutions of the Globe--Shore of the Atlantic Ocean where the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,English Colonies were founded--Difference in the appearance of North,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Exterior Form Of North America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North America presents in its external form certain general features,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A sort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,methodical order seems to have regulated the separation of land and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"water, mountains and valleys. A simple, but grand, arrangement is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discoverable amidst the confusion of objects and the prodigious variety,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of scenes. This continent is divided, almost equally, into two vast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regions, one of which is bounded on the north by the Arctic Pole, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the two great oceans on the east and west. It stretches towards the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"south, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length below","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great lakes of Canada. The second region begins where the other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"terminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. The one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slopes gently towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,north with so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a level plain. Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are neither high mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"irregularly: great rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"disperse and form vast marshes, losing all trace of their channels","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the labyrinth of waters they have themselves created; and thus, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"length, after innumerable windings, fall into the Polar Seas. The great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lakes which bound this first region are not walled in, like most of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their banks are flat,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each of them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,structure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either towards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Pole or to the tropical sea.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extreme to the other; the Alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Atlantic Ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific. The space,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which lies between these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,square miles. *a Its surface is therefore about six times as great as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that of France. This vast territory, however, forms a single valley,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one side of which descends gradually from the rounded summits of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the valley flows an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immense river, into which the various streams issuing from the mountains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fall from all parts. In memory of their native land, the French formerly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"called this river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous language,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"regions of which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"table-land where they unite. Near the same spot rises another river, *b","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which empties itself into the Polar seas. The course of the Mississippi,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is at first dubious: it winds several times towards the north, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whence it rose; and at length, after having been delayed in lakes and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"marshes, it flows slowly onwards to the south. Sometimes quietly gliding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"along the argillaceous bed which nature has assigned to it, sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles in its course.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*c At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river attains an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by vessels of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles. Fifty-seven large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,navigable rivers contribute to swell the waters of the Mississippi;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amongst others, the Missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Arkansas of 1,300 miles, the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in length, viz., the Illinois, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"St. Peter's, the St. Francis, and the Moingona; besides a countless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bed of this mighty river, which, like a god of antiquity, dispenses both","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,good and evil in its course. On the shores of the stream nature displays,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an inexhaustible fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the powers of vegetation languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that survive have a sickly growth. Nowhere have the great convulsions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the globe left more evident traces than in the valley of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Mississippi; the whole aspect of the country shows the powerful effects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of water, both by its fertility and by its barrenness. The waters of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of vegetable mould in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"valley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the right shore of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"river are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the husbandman had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passed over them with his roller. As you approach the mountains the soil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"becomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bones of a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"earth is covered with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"among which a few plants force their growth, and give the appearance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a green field covered with the ruins of a vast edifice. These stones and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this sand discover, on examination, a perfect analogy with those which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,compose the arid and broken summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of waters which washed the soil to the bottom of the valley afterwards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"carried away portions of the rocks themselves; and these, dashed and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were left scattered like wrecks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at their feet. *d The valley of the Mississippi is, upon the whole, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most magnificent dwelling-place prepared by God for man's abode; and yet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"sand, which the sea appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,breadth of this territory does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,about nine hundred miles in length. This part of the American continent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,were made. The tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,colonies which were destined one day to become the United States of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America. The centre of power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West Indies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and afterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,transported into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The sea,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sparkled with phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its waters discovered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been hidden in the deep abyss. *e Here and there appeared little islands,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfumed with odoriferous plants, and resembling baskets of flowers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,floating on the tranquil surface of the ocean. Every object which met,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the sight, in this enchanting region, seemed prepared to satisfy the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wants or contribute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the trees were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"loaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"groves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and oleanders, which were hung with festoons of various climbing plants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,North America appeared under a very different aspect; there everything,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intelligence, as the South was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foggy ocean washed its shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rocks, or by wide tracts of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"olive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer belt lay the thick shades","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the central forest, where the largest trees which are produced in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the two hemispheres grow side by side. The plane, the catalpa, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sugar-maple, and the Virginian poplar mingled their branches with those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the oak, the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Old World, destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of vegetation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were heaped upon each other; but there was no laboring hand to remove,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them, and their decay was not rapid enough to make room for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continual work of reproduction. Climbing plants, grasses, and other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,herbs forced their way through the mass of dying trees; they crept along,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty cavities, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its assistance to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"life, and their respective productions were mingled together. The depths","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand rivulets,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undirected in their course by human industry, preserved in them a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constant moisture. It was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"birds beneath their shades. The fall of a tree overthrown by age,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the rushing torrent of a cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,howling of the wind were the only sounds which broke the silence of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"To the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared; in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stead were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether Nature in her,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"infinite variety had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or whether they had once been covered with forests, subsequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"destroyed by the hand of man, is a question which neither tradition nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scientific research has been able to resolve.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"These immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human inhabitants.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Some wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shades or the green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Lawrence to the delta of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Pacific Ocean, these savages possessed certain points of resemblance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which bore witness of their common origin; but at the same time they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,differed from all other known races of men: *g they were neither white,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the Asiatics, nor black like","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the negroes. Their skin was reddish brown, their hair long and shining,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their lips thin, and their cheekbones very prominent. The languages","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spoken by the North American tribes are various as far as regarded their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"words, but they were subject to the same grammatical rules. These rules","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,differed in several points from such as had been observed to govern the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,origin of language. The idiom of the Americans seemed to be the product,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of new combinations, and bespoke an effort of the understanding of which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Indians of our days would be incapable. *h,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote g: With the progress of discovery some resemblance has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"found to exist between the physical conformation, the language, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the habits of the Indians of North America, and those of the Tongous,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Mantchous, Mongols, Tartars, and other wandering tribes of Asia. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"land occupied by these tribes is not very distant from Behring's Strait,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which allows of the supposition, that at a remote period they gave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants to the desert continent of America. But this is a point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which has not yet been clearly elucidated by science. See Malte Brun,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"[Footnote h: See Appendix, C.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The social state of these tribes differed also in many respects from all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have multiplied freely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the midst of their deserts without coming in contact with other races,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more civilized than their own. Accordingly, they exhibited none of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indistinct, incoherent notions of right and wrong, none of that deep","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"corruption of manners, which is usually joined with ignorance and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rudeness among nations which, after advancing to civilization, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relapsed into a state of barbarism. The Indian was indebted to no one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but himself; his virtues, his vices, and his prejudices were his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,work; he had grown up in the wild independence of his nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are rude and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"uncivil, it is not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"being so, they are in daily contact with rich and enlightened men.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The sight of their own hard lot and of their weakness, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,daily contrasted with the happiness and power of some of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-creatures, excites in their hearts at the same time the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sentiments of anger and of fear: the consciousness of their inferiority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of their dependence irritates while it humiliates them. This state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of mind displays itself in their manners and language; they are at once,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insolent and servile. The truth of this is easily proved by observation;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people are more rude in aristocratic countries than elsewhere, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opulent cities than in rural districts. In those places where the rich,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and powerful are assembled together the weak and the indigent feel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves oppressed by their inferior condition. Unable to perceive a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"single chance of regaining their equality, they give up to despair, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,allow themselves to fall below the dignity of human nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not observable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in savage life: the Indians, although they are ignorant and poor, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,equal and free. At the period when Europeans first came among them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the natives of North America were ignorant of the value of riches, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,indifferent to the enjoyments which civilized man procures to himself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by their means. Nevertheless there was nothing coarse in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,demeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a kind of aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"politeness. Mild and hospitable when at peace, though merciless in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"war beyond any known degree of human ferocity, the Indian would expose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,himself to die of hunger in order to succor the stranger who asked,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,admittance by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with his hands the still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republics of antiquity never gave examples of more unshaken courage,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more haughty spirits, or more intractable love of independence than were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hidden in former times among the wild forests of the New World. *i The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europeans produced no great impression when they landed upon the shores,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of North America; their presence engendered neither envy nor fear. What,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence could they possess over such men as we have described? The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Indian could live without wants, suffer without complaint, and pour out","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his death-song at the stake. *j Like all the other members of the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human family, these savages believed in the existence of a better world,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and adored under different names, God, the creator of the universe.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,After the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely spent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up the world receives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him, when his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellows. He is then studied for the first time, and it is imagined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the germ of the vices and the virtues of his maturer years is then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed. This, if I am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,higher up; we must watch the infant in its mother's arms; we must see,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the first images which the external world casts upon the dark mirror,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of his mind; the first occurrences which he witnesses; we must hear the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his earliest efforts, if we would understand the prejudices, the habits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the passions which will rule his life. The entire man is, so to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The growth of nations presents something analogous to this: they all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"being. If we were able to go back to the elements of states, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"examine the oldest monuments of their history, I doubt not that we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"should discover the primal cause of the prejudices, the habits, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ruling passions, and, in short, of all that constitutes what is called","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the national character; we should then find the explanation of certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,customs which now seem at variance with the prevailing manners; of such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws as conflict with established principles; and of such incoherent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions as are here and there to be met with in society, like those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fragments of broken chains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of an edifice, and supporting nothing. This might explain the destinies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of certain nations, which seem borne on by an unknown force to ends of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they themselves are ignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to researches of this kind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,communities in their latter days; and when they at length contemplated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their origin, time had already obscured it, or ignorance and pride","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adorned it with truth-concealing fables.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America is the only country in which it has been possible to witness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercised on the future condition of states by their origin is clearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinguishable. At the period when the peoples of Europe landed in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New World their national characteristics were already completely formed;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,each of them had a physiognomy of its own; and as they had already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attained that stage of civilization at which men are led to study,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful picture of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions, their manners, and their laws. The men of the sixteenth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"century are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries. America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequently, exhibits in the broad light of day the phenomena which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ignorance or rudeness of earlier ages conceals from our researches.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Near enough to the time when the states of America were founded, to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accurately acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that period to judge of some of their results, the men of our own day","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seem destined to see further than their predecessors into the series of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,human events. Providence has given us a torch which our forefathers did,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not possess, and has allowed us to discern fundamental causes in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,history of the world which the obscurity of the past concealed from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them. If we carefully examine the social and political state of America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after having studied its history, we shall remain perfectly convinced","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that not an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"event, is upon record which the origin of that people will not explain.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The readers of this book will find the germ of all that is to follow in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the present chapter, and the key to almost the whole work.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,covered by the American Union differed from each other in many respects;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles. These men had, however, certain features in common, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they were all placed in an analogous situation. The tie of language is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite mankind. All,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the emigrants spoke the same tongue; they were all offsets from the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people. Born in a country which had been agitated for centuries by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"struggles of faction, and in which all parties had been obliged in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their turn to place themselves under the protection of the laws, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political education had been perfected in this rude school, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were more conversant with the notions of right and the principles of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true freedom than the greater part of their European contemporaries. At,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the period of their first emigrations the parish system, that fruitful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"germ of free institutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,English; and with it the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been introduced into the bosom of the monarchy of the House of Tudor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rife. England had plunged into the new order of things with headlong,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vehemence. The character of its inhabitants, which had always been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sedate and reflective, became argumentative and austere. General","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"information had been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had received a deeper cultivation. Whilst religion was the topic of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"discussion, the morals of the people were reformed. All these national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,features are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Atlantic.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Another remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"applicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and all the Europeans who successively established themselves in the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"World. All these European colonies contained the elements, if not the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"development, of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had in general no notion of superiority over one another. The happy and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the powerful do not go into exile, and there are no surer guarantees of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equality among men than poverty and misfortune. It happened, however,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on several occasions, that persons of rank were driven to America","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to establish a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of America was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that refractory land into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the owner himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its produce was found","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be insufficient to enrich a master and a farmer at the same time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The land was then naturally broken up into small portions, which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proprietor cultivated for himself. Land is the basis of an aristocracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which clings to the soil that supports it; for it is not by privileges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alone, nor by birth, but by landed property handed down from generation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to generation, that an aristocracy is constituted. A nation may present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immense fortunes and extreme wretchedness, but unless those fortunes are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"territorial there is no aristocracy, but simply the class of the rich","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and that of the poor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"epoch of their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seemed destined to witness the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of their mother-country, but of that freedom of the middle and lower","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,orders of which the history of the world had as yet furnished no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,complete example.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In this general uniformity several striking differences were however,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"discernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up without entirely commingling; the one in the South, the other in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Virginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of it in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the sources of national wealth was at that time singularly prevalent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe; a fatal delusion, which has done more to impoverish the nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which adopted it, and has cost more lives in America, than the united","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of war and bad laws. The men sent to Virginia *a were seekers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of gold, adventurers, without resources and without character, whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"afterwards; and, although they were a more moral and orderly race of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"men, they were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"England. *c No lofty conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foundation of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when slavery was introduced, *d and this was the main circumstance which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has exercised so prodigious an influence on the character, the laws, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the future prospects of the South. Slavery, as we shall afterwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"show, dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into society, and with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and distress. It enervates the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powers of the mind, and benumbs the activity of man. The influence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavery, united to the English character, explains the manners and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,social condition of the Southern States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: The charter granted by the Crown of England in 1609,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stipulated, amongst other conditions, that the adventurers should pay","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the Crown a fifth of the produce of all gold and silver mines. See,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Marshall's ""Life of Washington,"" vol. i. pp. 18-66.] [Footnote b: A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"large portion of the adventurers, says Stith (""History of Virginia""),","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were unprincipled young men of family, whom their parents were glad to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ship off, discharged servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others of the same class, people more apt to pillage and destroy than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to assist the settlement, were the seditious chiefs, who easily led this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,band into every kind of extravagance and excess. See for the history of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the North, the same English foundation was modified by the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposite shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some details. The two or three main ideas which constitute the basis,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the social theory of the United States were first combined in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Northern English colonies, more generally denominated the States of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New England. *e The principles of New England spread at first to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,neighboring states; they then passed successively to the more distant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ones; and at length they imbued the whole Confederation. They now extend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their influence beyond its limits over the whole American world. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization of New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,horizon with its glow.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote e: The States of New England are those situated to the east of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Hudson; they are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2, Rhode Island;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"3, Massachusetts; 4, Vermont; 5, New Hampshire; 6, Maine.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances attending it were singular and original. The large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority of colonies have been first inhabited either by men without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"education and without resources, driven by their poverty and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"misconduct from the land which gave them birth, or by speculators","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and adventurers greedy of gain. Some settlements cannot even boast so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,honorable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by buccaneers; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,criminal courts of England originally supplied the population of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Australia.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,belonged to the more independent classes of their native country. Their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,union on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a society containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nor poor. These men possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mass of intelligence than is to be found in any European nation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"our own time. All, without a single exception, had received a good","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"education, and many of them were known in Europe for their talents and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their acquirements. The other colonies had been founded by adventurers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without family; the emigrants of New England brought with them the best,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elements of order and morality--they landed in the desert accompanied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by their wives and children. But what most especially distinguished them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was the aim of their undertaking. They had not been obliged by necessity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to leave their country; the social position they abandoned was one to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain. Nor did","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they cross the Atlantic to improve their situation or to increase their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wealth; the call which summoned them from the comforts of their homes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was purely intellectual; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exile their object was the triumph of an idea.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the Pilgrims,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,belonged to that English sect the austerity of whose principles had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquired for them the name of Puritans. Puritanism was not merely a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religious doctrine, but it corresponded in many points with the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,absolute democratic and republican theories. It was this tendency which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had aroused its most dangerous adversaries. Persecuted by the Government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the mother-country, and disgusted by the habits of a society opposed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the rigor of their own principles, the Puritans went forth to seek","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some rude and unfrequented part of the world, where they could live","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"according to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The English Government was not dissatisfied with an emigration which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,removed the elements of fresh discord and of further revolutions. On the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, everything was done to encourage it, and great exertions were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,made to mitigate the hardships of those who sought a shelter from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rigor of their country's laws on the soil of America. It seemed as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if New England was a region given up to the dreams of fancy and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unrestrained experiments of innovators.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity) have always enjoyed more internal freedom and more political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independence than the colonies of other nations; but this principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberty was nowhere more extensively applied than in the States of New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,England.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New World belonged to that European nation which had been the first to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discover them. Nearly the whole coast of North America thus became a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,British possession towards the end of the sixteenth century. The means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,used by the English Government to people these new domains were of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several kinds; the King sometimes appointed a governor of his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"choice, who ruled a portion of the New World in the name and under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,immediate orders of the Crown; *j this is the colonial system adopted by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other countries of Europe. Sometimes grants of certain tracts were made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the Crown to an individual or to a company, *k in which case all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civil and political power fell into the hands of one or more persons,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who, under the inspection and control of the Crown, sold the lands and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governed the inhabitants. Lastly, a third system consisted in allowing a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain number of emigrants to constitute a political society under the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"protection of the mother-country, and to govern themselves in whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was not contrary to her laws. This mode of colonization, so remarkably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the code of laws promulgated by the little State of Connecticut in 1650.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*p The legislators of Connecticut *q begin with the penal laws, and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"strange to say, they borrow their provisions from the text of Holy Writ.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""Whosoever shall worship any other God than the Lord,"" says the preamble","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,rude and half-civilized people was thus applied to an enlightened and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"this subject, which occurred in the year 1663. A married woman had had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"criminal intercourse with a young man; her husband died, and she married","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"put upon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital punishment.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws, was the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in the community: they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constantly invaded the domain of conscience, and there was scarcely a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sin which was not subject to magisterial censure. The reader is aware of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rigor with which these laws punished rape and adultery; intercourse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between unmarried persons was likewise severely repressed. The judge was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"empowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or marriage *s on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the misdemeanants; and if the records of the old courts of New Haven may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be believed, prosecutions of this kind were not unfrequent. We find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a sentence bearing date the first of May, 1660, inflicting a fine and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reprimand on a young woman who was accused of using improper language,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of allowing herself to be kissed. *t The Code of 1650 abounds in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preventive measures. It punishes idleness and drunkenness with severity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*u Innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more than a certain quantity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liquor to each consumer; and simple lying, whenever it may be injurious,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*v is checked by a fine or a flogging. In other places, the legislator,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,entirely forgetting the great principles of religious toleration which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he had himself upheld in Europe, renders attendance on divine service","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,enactments induces him to descend to the most frivolous particulars:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thus a law is to be found in the same Code which prohibits the use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of tobacco. *y It must not be forgotten that these fantastical and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,passions which had been warmed by persecution and were still fermenting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"among the people, a body of political laws is to be found, which, though","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"written two hundred years ago, is still ahead of the liberties of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,our age. The general principles which are the groundwork of modern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitutions--principles which were imperfectly known in Europe, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the seventeenth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,century--were all recognized and determined by the laws of New England:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty, and trial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by jury, were all positively established without discussion. From these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fruitful principles consequences have been derived and applications have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,which is the life and mainspring of American liberty at the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day. The political existence of the majority of the nations of Europe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commenced in the superior ranks of society, and was gradually and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imperfectly communicated to the different members of the social body.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"organized before the county, the county before the State, the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,before the Union. In New England townships were completely and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,definitively constituted as early as 1650. The independence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"township was the nucleus round which the local interests, passions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, and duties collected and clung. It gave scope to the activity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a real political life most thoroughly democratic and republican. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,colonies still recognized the supremacy of the mother-country; monarchy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was still the law of the State; but the republic was already established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in every township. The towns named their own magistrates of every kind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rated themselves, and levied their own taxes. *e In the parish of New","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"England the law of representation was not adopted, but the affairs of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the community were discussed, as at Athens, in the market-place, by a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,acquaintance with the science of government and the advanced theory of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation which they display. The ideas there formed of the duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of society towards its members are evidently much loftier and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comprehensive than those of the European legislators at that time:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted. In the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States of New England, from the first, the condition of the poor was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provided for; *f strict measures were taken for the maintenance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"roads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them; *g registers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were established in every parish, in which the results of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deliberations, and the births, deaths, and marriages of the citizens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were entered; *h clerks were directed to keep these registers; *i,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers were charged with the administration of vacant inheritances,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and with the arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,created whose chief functions were the maintenance of public order in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the community. *j The law enters into a thousand useful provisions for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,support them. Schools of a superior kind were founded in the same manner,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the more populous districts. The municipal authorities were bound to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enforce the sending of children to school by their parents; they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,empowered to inflict fines upon all who refused compliance; and in case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,which he used to so bad a purpose. The reader will undoubtedly have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remarked the preamble of these enactments: in America religion is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of the Continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with astonishment. On the Continent of Europe, at the beginning of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seventeenth century, absolute monarchy had everywhere triumphed over the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberties of the Middle Ages. Never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were the notions of right more completely confounded than in the midst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the splendor and literature of Europe; never was there less political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,activity among the people; never were the principles of true freedom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less widely circulated; and at that very time those principles, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were scorned or unknown by the nations of Europe, were proclaimed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the deserts of the New World, and were accepted as the future creed of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a great people. The boldest theories of the human reason were put into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,practice by a community so humble that not a statesman condescended to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attend to it; and a legislation without a precedent was produced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offhand by the imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obscure democracy, which had as yet brought forth neither generals, nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"philosophers, nor authors, a man might stand up in the face of a free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Anglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the result (and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct elements),","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which in other places have been in frequent hostility, but which in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I allude to the spirit of Religion and the spirit of Liberty.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and daring innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"family, and their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so dear a rate. The energy, however, with which they strove for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberties of the world, is scarcely inferior to that with which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,devoted themselves to Heaven.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Political principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were born were broken down before them; the old principles which had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governed the world for ages were no more; a path without a turn and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,curiosity of man: but at the limits of the political world he checks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"submissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moral world everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the one is a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independence scornful of experience and jealous of authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"These two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Religion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faculties of man, and that the political world is a field prepared by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"freedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"place which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,established than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the companion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the divine source of its claims. The safeguard of morality is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inference from what has been said. The social condition, the religion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the manners of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence on the destiny of their new country. Nevertheless they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not in a situation to found a state of things solely dependent on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves: no man can entirely shake off the influence of the past, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the settlers, intentionally or involuntarily, mingled habits and notions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derived from their education and from the traditions of their country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with those habits and notions which were exclusively their own. To form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a judgment on the Anglo-Americans of the present day it is therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessary to distinguish what is of Puritanical and what is of English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,origin.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Laws and customs are frequently to be met with in the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. These laws seem to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be drawn up in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation; and these customs are no less opposed to the tone of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society. If the English colonies had been founded in an age of darkness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years, the problem","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be insoluble.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civil and criminal procedure of the Americans has only two means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,action--committal and bail. The first measure taken by the magistrate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is to exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incarcerate him: the ground of the accusation and the importance of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,charges against him are then discussed. It is evident that a legislation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this kind is hostile to the poor man, and favorable only to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rich. The poor man has not always a security to produce, even in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for justice in prison, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speedily reduced to distress. The wealthy individual, on the contrary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"always escapes imprisonment in civil causes; nay, more, he may readily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elude the punishment which awaits him for a delinquency by breaking his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bail. So that all the penalties of the law are, for him, reducible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to fines. *n Nothing can be more aristocratic than this system of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislation. Yet in America it is the poor who make the law, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,usually reserve the greatest social advantages to themselves. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in England; the laws of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which I speak are English, *o and the Americans have retained them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,however repugnant they may be to the tenor of their legislation and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mass of their ideas. Next to its habits, the thing which a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is least apt to change is its civil legislation. Civil laws are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"familiarly known to legal men, whose direct interest it is to maintain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them as they are, whether good or bad, simply because they themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are conversant with them. The body of the nation is scarcely acquainted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with them; it merely perceives their action in particular cases; but it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has some difficulty in seizing their tendency, and obeys them without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,premeditation. I have quoted one instance where it would have been easy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to adduce a great number of others. The surface of American society is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if I may use the expression, covered with a layer of democracy, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Many important observations suggest themselves upon the social condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Anglo-Americans, but there is one which takes precedence of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rest. The social condition of the Americans is eminently democratic;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this was its character at the foundation of the Colonies, and is still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more strongly marked at the present day. I have stated in the preceding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chapter that great equality existed among the emigrants who settled on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the shores of New England. The germ of aristocracy was never planted in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that part of the Union. The only influence which obtained there was that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of intellect; the people were used to reverence certain names as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,emblems of knowledge and virtue. Some of their fellow-citizens acquired,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a power over the rest which might truly have been called aristocratic,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,was different. In most of the States situated to the south-west of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Hudson some great English proprietors had settled, who had imported","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with them aristocratic principles and the English law of descent. I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,explained the reasons why it was impossible ever to establish a powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy in America; these reasons existed with less force to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"south-west of the Hudson. In the South, one man, aided by slaves, could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cultivate a great extent of country: it was therefore common to see rich,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,landed proprietors. But their influence was not altogether aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as that term is understood in Europe, since they possessed no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,privileges; and the cultivation of their estates being carried on by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slaves, they had no tenants depending on them, and consequently no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"patronage. Still, the great proprietors south of the Hudson constituted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a superior class, having ideas and tastes of its own, and forming the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centre of political action. This kind of aristocracy sympathized with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the body of the people, whose passions and interests it easily embraced;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but it was too weak and too short-lived to excite either love or hatred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for itself. This was the class which headed the insurrection in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, and furnished the best leaders of the American revolution.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At the period of which we are now speaking society was shaken to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its centre: the people, in whose name the struggle had taken place,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conceived the desire of exercising the authority which it had acquired;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its democratic tendencies were awakened; and having thrown off the yoke,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the mother-country, it aspired to independence of every kind. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence of individuals gradually ceased to be felt, and custom and law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,united together to produce the same result.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am surprised,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that ancient and modern jurists have not attributed to this law a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,greater influence on human affairs. *a It is true that these laws belong,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to civil affairs; but they ought nevertheless to be placed at the head,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of all political institutions; for, whilst political laws are only the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"symbol of a nation's condition, they exercise an incredible influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon its social state. They have, moreover, a sure and uniform manner of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"operating upon society, affecting, as it were, generations yet unborn.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principal object is to regulate the distribution of property after the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,death of its owner. The law of entail is of this number; it certainly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevents the owner from disposing of his possessions before his death;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but this is solely with the view of preserving them entire for the heir.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The principal object, therefore, of the law of entail is to regulate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descent of property after the death of its owner: its other provisions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are merely means to this end.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Through their means man acquires a kind of preternatural power over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,future lot of his fellow-creatures. When the legislator has regulated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the law of inheritance, he may rest from his labor. The machine once put","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in motion will go on for ages, and advance, as if self-guided, towards a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"given point. When framed in a particular manner, this law unites, draws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"together, and vests property and power in a few hands: its tendency is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,clearly aristocratic. On opposite principles its action is still more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rapid; it divides, distributes, and disperses both property and power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Alarmed by the rapidity of its progress, those who despair of arresting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its motion endeavor to obstruct it by difficulties and impediments;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they vainly seek to counteract its effect by contrary efforts; but it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until by its incessant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,activity the bulwarks of the influence of wealth are ground down to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fine and shifting sand which is the basis of democracy. When the law of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inheritance permits, still more when it decrees, the equal division of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a father's property amongst all his children, its effects are of two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"kinds: it is important to distinguish them from each other, although","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they tend to the same end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proprietor brings about a kind of revolution in property; not only do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his possessions change hands, but their very nature is altered, since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are parcelled into shares, which become smaller and smaller at each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"division. This is the direct and, as it were, the physical effect of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"law. It follows, then, that in countries where equality of inheritance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is established by law, property, and especially landed property, must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have a tendency to perpetual diminution. The effects, however, of such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislation would only be perceptible after a lapse of time, if the law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was abandoned to its own working; for supposing the family to consist of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two children (and in a country people as France is the average number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is not above three), these children, sharing amongst them the fortune of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"both parents, would not be poorer than their father or mother.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the law of equal division exercises its influence not merely upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the property itself, but it affects the minds of the heirs, and brings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their passions into play. These indirect consequences tend powerfully,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the destruction of large fortunes, and especially of large domains.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Among nations whose law of descent is founded upon the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,primogeniture landed estates often pass from generation to generation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without undergoing division, the consequence of which is that family","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,feeling is to a certain degree incorporated with the estate. The family,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represents the estate, the estate the family; whose name, together with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its origin, its glory, its power, and its virtues, is thus perpetuated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in an imperishable memorial of the past and a sure pledge of the future.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the equal partition of property is established by law, the intimate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,connection is destroyed between family feeling and the preservation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the paternal estate; the property ceases to represent the family; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as it must inevitably be divided after one or two generations, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has evidently a constant tendency to diminish, and must in the end be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"completely dispersed. The sons of the great landed proprietor, if they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are few in number, or if fortune befriends them, may indeed entertain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the hope of being as wealthy as their father, but not that of possessing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same property as he did; the riches must necessarily be composed of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elements different from his.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Now, from the moment that you divest the landowner of that interest in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tradition, and from family pride, you may be certain that sooner or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,later he will dispose of it; for there is a strong pecuniary interest in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"favor of selling, as floating capital produces higher interest than real","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"property, and is more readily available to gratify the passions of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,moment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Great landed estates which have once been divided never come together,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"again; for the small proprietor draws from his land a better revenue, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proportion, than the large owner does from his, and of course he sells","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it at a higher rate. *b The calculations of gain, therefore, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decide the rich man to sell his domain will still more powerfully,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence him against buying small estates to unite them into a large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote b: I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his land better, but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he makes up by his labor for his want of skill.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,What is called family pride is often founded upon an illusion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"self-love. A man wishes to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were, in his great-grandchildren. Where the esprit de famille ceases","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to act individual selfishness comes into play. When the idea of family,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"becomes vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present convenience; he provides for the establishment of his succeeding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"generation, and no more. Either a man gives up the idea of perpetuating","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his family, or at any rate he seeks to accomplish it by other means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than that of a landed estate. Thus not only does the law of partible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inheritance render it difficult for families to preserve their ancestral,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"domains entire, but it deprives them of the inclination to attempt it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and compels them in some measure to co-operate with the law in their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extinction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"things, it acts upon persons; by influencing persons, it affects things.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,By these means the law succeeds in striking at the root of landed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"property, and dispersing rapidly both families and fortunes. *c","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote c: Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time to time, rich individuals who are disposed to make great sacrifices","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in order to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their income to make sure of the rest. But these are accidental cases.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The preference for landed property is no longer found habitually in any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"class but among the poor. The small landowner, who has less information,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less imagination, and fewer passions than the great one, is generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,occupied with the desire of increasing his estate: and it often happens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of trade, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the tendency which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"leads men to divide their estates, there exists another, which incites","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them to add to them. This tendency, which is sufficient to prevent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"estates from being divided ad infinitum, is not strong enough to create","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great territorial possessions, certainly not to keep them up in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,family.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Most certainly it is not for us Frenchmen of the nineteenth century,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who daily witness the political and social changes which the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of partition is bringing to pass, to question its influence. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perpetually conspicuous in our country, overthrowing the walls of our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dwellings and removing the landmarks of our fields. But although it has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"produced great effects in France, much still remains for it to do. Our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recollections, opinions, and habits present powerful obstacles to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,progress.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States it has nearly completed its work of destruction,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and there we can best study its results. The English laws concerning the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,transmission of property were abolished in almost all the States at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the time of the Revolution. The law of entail was so modified as not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to interrupt the free circulation of property. *d The first generation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"having passed away, estates began to be parcelled out, and the change","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"became more and more rapid with the progress of time. At this moment,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the aspect of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is totally altered; the families of the great landed proprietors are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"almost all commingled with the general mass. In the State of New York,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which formerly contained many of these, there are but two who still keep","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear. The sons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of these opulent citizens are become merchants, lawyers, or physicians.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Most of them have lapsed into obscurity. The last trace of hereditary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ranks and distinctions is destroyed--the law of partition has reduced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all to one level. [Footnote d: See Appendix, G.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taken stronger hold on the affections of men, and where the profounder","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,gives a very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the West and South-west. At the end of the last century a few bold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,communities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States whose names were not in existence a few years before claimed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their place in the American Union; and in the Western settlements we may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"behold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme. In these States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"founded off-hand, and, as it were, by chance, the inhabitants are but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of yesterday. Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are ignorant of each other's history. In this part of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continent, therefore, the population has not experienced the influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of great names and great wealth, nor even that of the natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy of knowledge and virtue. None are there to wield that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,respectable power which men willingly grant to the remembrance of a life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spent in doing good before their eyes. The new States of the West are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"already inhabited, but society has no existence among them. *e","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,influence on American society.---Translator's Note.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in America; even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their requirements partake in some degree of the same uniformity. I do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not believe that there is a country in the world where, in proportion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the population, there are so few uninstructed and at the same time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so few learned individuals. Primary instruction is within the reach of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,everybody; superior instruction is scarcely to be obtained by any. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is not surprising; it is in fact the necessary consequence of what we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have advanced above. Almost all the Americans are in easy circumstances,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and can therefore obtain the first elements of human knowledge.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America there are comparatively few who are rich enough to live,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without a profession. Every profession requires an apprenticeship, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,limits the time of instruction to the early years of life. At fifteen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they enter upon their calling, and thus their education ends at the age","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when ours begins. Whatever is done afterwards is with a view to some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,special and lucrative object; a science is taken up as a matter of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"business, and the only branch of it which is attended to is such as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,admits of an immediate practical application. In America most of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rich men were formerly poor; most of those who now enjoy leisure were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"absorbed in business during their youth; the consequence of which is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that when they might have had a taste for study they had no time for it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and when time is at their disposal they have no longer the inclination.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"There is no class, then, in America, in which the taste for intellectual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and leisure, and by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the labors of the intellect are held in honor. Accordingly there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is an equal want of the desire and the power of application to these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,objects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Of course, an immense multitude of persons are to be found who entertain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same number of ideas on religion, history, science, political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"economy, legislation, and government. The gifts of intellect proceed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"directly from God, and man cannot prevent their unequal distribution.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But in consequence of the state of things which we have here represented,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it happens that, although the capacities of men are widely different, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Political Consequences Of The Social Condition Of The Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The political consequences of such a social condition as this are easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,deducible. It is impossible to believe that equality will not eventually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,find its way into the political world as it does everywhere else. To,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conceive of men remaining forever unequal upon one single point, yet","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equal on all others, is impossible; they must come in the end to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,equal upon all. Now I know of only two methods of establishing equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the political world; every citizen must be put in possession of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his rights, or rights must be granted to no one. For nations which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arrived at the same stage of social existence as the Anglo-Americans, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is therefore very difficult to discover a medium between the sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of all and the absolute power of one man: and it would be vain to deny,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the social condition which I have been describing is equally liable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to each of these consequences.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"There is, in fact, a manly and lawful passion for equality which excites","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men to wish all to be powerful and honored. This passion tends to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elevate the humble to the rank of the great; but there exists also in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to attempt to lower the powerful to their own level, and reduces men to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prefer equality in slavery to inequality with freedom. Not that those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations whose social condition is democratic naturally despise liberty;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on the contrary, they have an instinctive love of it. But liberty is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the chief and constant object of their desires; equality is their idol:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty, and if they miss","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their aim resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"satisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,against the aggressions of power. No one among them being strong,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enough to engage in the struggle with advantage, nothing but a general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"begin. The principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"found, more or less, at the bottom of almost all human institutions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally remains concealed from view. It is obeyed without being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recognized, or if for a moment it be brought to light, it is hastily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cast back into the gloom of the sanctuary. ""The will of the nation"" is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one of those expressions which have been most profusely abused by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wily and the despotic of every age. To the eyes of some it has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represented by the venal suffrages of a few of the satellites of power;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to others by the votes of a timid or an interested minority; and some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have even discovered it in the silence of a people, on the supposition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the fact of submission established the right of command.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"barren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the customs and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arrives without impediment at its most remote consequences. If there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be a country in the world where the doctrine of the sovereignty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people can be fairly appreciated, where it can be studied in its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"application to the affairs of society, and where its dangers and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people was the fundamental principle of the greater number of British,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"colonies in America. It was far, however, from then exercising as much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence on the government of society as it now does. Two obstacles,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the one external, the other internal, checked its invasive progress. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,could not ostensibly disclose itself in the laws of colonies which were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still constrained to obey the mother-country: it was therefore obliged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to spread secretly, and to gain ground in the provincial assemblies, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,especially in the townships.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American society was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences. The intelligence of New England, and the wealth of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country to the south of the Hudson (as I have shown in the preceding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"chapter), long exercised a sort of aristocratic influence, which tended","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to retain the exercise of social authority in the hands of a few. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public functionaries were not universally elected, and the citizens were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not all of them electors. The electoral franchise was everywhere placed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within certain limits, and made dependent on a certain qualification,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which was exceedingly low in the North and more considerable in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The American revolution broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the people, which had been nurtured in the townships and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"municipalities, took possession of the State: every class was enlisted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in its cause; battles were fought, and victories obtained for it, until","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it became the law of laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A no less rapid change was effected in the interior of society, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the law of descent completed the abolition of local influences.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At the very time when this consequence of the laws and of the revolution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was apparent to every eye, victory was irrevocably pronounced in favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the democratic cause. All power was, in fact, in its hands, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resistance was no longer possible. The higher orders submitted without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a murmur and without a struggle to an evil which was thenceforth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inevitable. The ordinary fate of falling powers awaited them; each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their several members followed his own interests; and as it was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible to wring the power from the hands of a people which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"did not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to secure its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,good-will at any price. The most democratic laws were consequently voted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the very men whose interests they impaired; and thus, although the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,higher classes did not excite the passions of the people against their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order, they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things; so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that by a singular change the democratic impulse was found to be most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,irresistible in the very States where the aristocracy had the firmest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hold. The State of Maryland, which had been founded by men of rank,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was the first to proclaim universal suffrage, and to introduce the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic forms into the conduct of its government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreseen that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abolished. There is no more invariable rule in the history of society:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the further electoral rights are extended, the greater is the need of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extending them; for after each concession the strength of the democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increases, and its demands increase with its strength. The ambition of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those who are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the great number of those who are above it. The exception at last,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"becomes the rule, concession follows concession, and no stop can be made","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,short of universal suffrage.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the people has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquired, in the United States, all the practical development which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imagination can conceive. It is unencumbered by those fictions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have been thrown over it in other countries, and it appears in every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possible form according to the exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws are made by the people in a body, as at Athens; and sometimes its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representatives, chosen by universal suffrage, transact business in its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"name, and almost under its immediate control.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In some countries a power exists which, though it is in a degree foreign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the social body, directs it, and forces it to pursue a certain track.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In others the ruling force is divided, being partly within and partly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without the ranks of the people. But nothing of the kind is to be seen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the United States; there society governs itself for itself. All power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centres in its bosom; and scarcely an individual is to be meet with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who would venture to conceive, or, still less, to express, the idea of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in the making of its laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the choice of its legislators, and in the execution of them by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,choice of the agents of the executive government; it may almost be said,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to govern itself, so feeble and so restricted is the share left to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administration, so little do the authorities forget their popular origin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the power from which they emanate. *a [Footnote a: See Appendix, H.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States Before That Of The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union At Large.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is proposed to examine in the following chapter what is the form of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government established in America on the principle of the sovereignty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its dangers. The first difficulty which presents itself arises from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"complex nature of the constitution of the United States, which consists","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of two distinct social structures, connected and, as it were, encased","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one within the other; two governments, completely separate and almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independent, the one fulfilling the ordinary duties and responding to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the daily and indefinite calls of a community, the other circumscribed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within certain limits, and only exercising an exceptional authority over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the general interests of the country. In short, there are twenty-four","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"small sovereign nations, whose agglomeration constitutes the body of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union. To examine the Union before we have studied the States would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be to adopt a method filled with obstacles. The form of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government of the United States was the last which was adopted; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is in fact nothing more than a modification or a summary of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republican principles which were current in the whole community before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it existed, and independently of its existence. Moreover, the Federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government is, as I have just observed, the exception; the Government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the States is the rule. The author who should attempt to exhibit the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,picture as a whole before he had explained its details would necessarily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fall into obscurity and repetition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The great political principles which govern American society at this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day undoubtedly took their origin and their growth in the State. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is therefore necessary to become acquainted with the State in order to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possess a clue to the remainder. The States which at present compose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the American Union all present the same features, as far as regards the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,external aspect of their institutions. Their political or administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence is centred in three focuses of action, which may not inaptly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be compared to the different nervous centres which convey motion to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human body. The township is the lowest in order, then the county, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lastly the State; and I propose to devote the following chapter to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,examination of these three divisions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American System Of Townships And Municipal Bodies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Why the Author begins the examination of the political institutions with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the township--Its existence in all nations--Difficulty of establishing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and preserving municipal independence--Its importance--Why the Author,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has selected the township system of New England as the main topic of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discussion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the Township.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The village or township is the only association which is so perfectly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural that wherever a number of men are collected it seems to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constitute itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a community, must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"necessarily exist in all nations, whatever their laws and customs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be: if man makes monarchies and establishes republics, the first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,association of mankind seems constituted by the hand of God. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"although the existence of the township is coeval with that of man, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberties are not the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation is always able to establish great political assemblies, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it habitually contains a certain number of individuals fitted by their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"talents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"township is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less easily fashioned by the legislator. The difficulties which attend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the increasing enlightenment of the people. A highly civilized community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"numerous blunders, and is apt to despair of success before the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"experiment is completed. Again, no immunities are so ill protected from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the encroachments of the supreme power as those of municipal bodies in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general: they are unable to struggle, single-handed, against a strong","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or an enterprising government, and they cannot defend their cause with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,success unless it be identified with the customs of the nation and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,supported by public opinion. Thus until the independence of townships is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amalgamated with the manners of a people it is easily destroyed, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is only after a long existence in the laws that it can be thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amalgamated. Municipal freedom is not the fruit of human device; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is rarely created; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,engendered in the midst of a semi-barbarous state of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The constant action of the laws and the national habits, peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances, and above all time, may consolidate it; but there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certainly no nation on the continent of Europe which has experienced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its advantages. Nevertheless local assemblies of citizens constitute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the strength of free nations. Town-meetings are to liberty what primary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"schools are to science; they bring it within the people's reach, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,teach men how to use and how to enjoy it. A nation may establish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a system of free government, but without the spirit of municipal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions it cannot have the spirit of liberty. The transient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passions and the interests of an hour, or the chance of circumstances,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may have created the external forms of independence; but the despotic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tendency which has been repelled will, sooner or later, inevitably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reappear on the surface.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In order to explain to the reader the general principles on which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political organization of the counties and townships of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States rests, I have thought it expedient to choose one of the States of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"New England as an example, to examine the mechanism of its constitution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and then to cast a general glance over the country. The township and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,county are not organized in the same manner in every part of the Union;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is, however, easy to perceive that the same principles have guided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the formation of both of them throughout the Union. I am inclined to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,believe that these principles have been carried further in New England,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than elsewhere, and consequently that they offer greater facilities to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the observations of a stranger. The institutions of New England form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a complete and regular whole; they have received the sanction of time,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they have the support of the laws, and the still stronger support of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manners of the community, over which they exercise the most prodigious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence; they consequently deserve our attention on every account.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"the English tithing, or town. Its average population is from two to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"three thousand; *a so that, on the one hand, the interests of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants are not likely to conflict, and, on the other, men capable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of conducting its affairs are always to be found among its citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,and administrative action of the government is in more immediate contact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the subject, the system of representation is not adopted. There is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no corporation; but the body of electors, after having designated its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The public duties in the township are extremely numerous and minutely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divided, as we shall see further on; but the larger proportion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administrative power is vested in the hands of a small number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals, called ""the Selectmen."" *c The general laws of the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impose a certain number of obligations on the selectmen, which they may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fulfil without the authorization of the body they represent, but which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they can only neglect on their own responsibility. The law of the State,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obliges them, for instance, to draw up the list of electors in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"townships; and if they omit this part of their functions, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"guilty of a misdemeanor. In all the affairs, however, which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"determined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are the organs of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"popular mandate, as in France the Maire executes the decree of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the electors on a certain day at an appointed place; they explain the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"it, on the probable expense, and the site which seems to be most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,favorable. The meeting is consulted on these several points; it adopts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have already observed that the principle of the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people governs the whole political system of the Anglo-Americans. Every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,page of this book will afford new instances of the same doctrine. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nations by which the sovereignty of the people is recognized every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual possesses an equal share of power, and participates alike in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the government of the State. Every individual is, therefore, supposed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be as well informed, as virtuous, and as strong as any of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he is inferior to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the authorities which conduct it, or that he is less capable than his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"neighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows that no such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,association can exist without a regulating force. If he be a subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in all that concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is free and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsible to God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence arises the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maxim that every one is the best and the sole judge of his own private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest, and that society has no right to control a man's actions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unless they are prejudicial to the common weal, or unless the common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weal demands his co-operation. This doctrine is universally admitted in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States. I shall hereafter examine the general influence which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it exercises on the ordinary actions of life; I am now speaking of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature of municipal bodies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the government of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, may be looked upon as an individual to whom the theory I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have just alluded to is applied. Municipal independence is therefore a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural consequence of the principle of the sovereignty of the people in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States: all the American republics recognize it more or less;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but circumstances have peculiarly favored its growth in New England.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In this part of the Union the impulsion of political activity was given,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the townships; and it may almost be said that each of them originally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formed an independent nation. When the Kings of England asserted their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supremacy, they were contented to assume the central power of the State.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The townships of New England remained as they were before; and although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are now subject to the State, they were at first scarcely dependent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon it. It is important to remember that they have not been invested,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with privileges, but that they have, on the contrary, forfeited a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,portion of their independence to the State. The townships are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subordinate to the State in those interests which I shall term social,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as they are common to all the citizens. They are independent in all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that concerns themselves; and amongst the inhabitants of New England,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I believe that not a man is to be found who would acknowledge that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State has any right to interfere in their local interests. The towns,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of New England buy and sell, sue or are sued, augment or diminish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their rates, without the slightest opposition on the part of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administrative authority of the State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the community. If","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State is in need of money, a town can neither give nor withhold the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supplies. If the State projects a road, the township cannot refuse to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"let it cross its territory; if a police regulation is made by the State,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it must be enforced by the town. A uniform system of instruction is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"organized all over the country, and every town is bound to establish the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,schools which the law ordains. In speaking of the administration of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States I shall have occasion to point out the means by which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,townships are compelled to obey in these different cases: I here merely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"show the existence of the obligation. Strict as this obligation is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the government of the State imposes it in principle only, and in its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"performance the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taxes are voted by the State, but they are levied and collected by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"township; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"builds, pays, and superintends it. In France the State-collector","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,receives the local imposts; in America the town-collector receives the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taxes of the State. Thus the French Government lends its agents to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commune; in America the township is the agent of the Government. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fact alone shows the extent of the differences which exist between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are kept alive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and supported by public spirit. The township of New England possesses,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mankind, namely, independence and authority. Its sphere is indeed small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and limited, but within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its independence gives to it a real importance which its extent and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population may not always ensure.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is to be remembered that the affections of men generally lie on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,side of authority. Patriotism is not durable in a conquered nation. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"New Englander is attached to his township, not only because he was born","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in it, but because it constitutes a social body of which he is a member,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and whose government claims and deserves the exercise of his sagacity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In Europe the absence of local public spirit is a frequent subject of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regret to those who are in power; everyone agrees that there is no surer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"guarantee of order and tranquility, and yet nothing is more difficult to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"create. If the municipal bodies were made powerful and independent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the authorities of the nation might be disunited and the peace of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country endangered. Yet, without power and independence, a town may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contain good subjects, but it can have no active citizens. Another","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,important fact is that the township of New England is so constituted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as to excite the warmest of human affections, without arousing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ambitious passions of the heart of man. The officers of the country are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not elected, and their authority is very limited. Even the State is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only a second-rate community, whose tranquil and obscure administration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offers no inducement sufficient to draw men away from the circle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their interests into the turmoil of public affairs. The federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government confers power and honor on the men who conduct it; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these individuals can never be very numerous. The high station of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Presidency can only be reached at an advanced period of life, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other federal functionaries are generally men who have been favored,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by fortune, or distinguished in some other career. Such cannot be the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,permanent aim of the ambitious. But the township serves as a centre for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the desire of public esteem, the want of exciting interests, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the taste for authority and popularity, in the midst of the ordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relations of life; and the passions which commonly embroil society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,change their character when they find a vent so near the domestic hearth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the family circle.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the American States power has been disseminated with admirable skill,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the purpose of interesting the greatest possible number of persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the common weal. Independently of the electors who are from time to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time called into action, the body politic is divided into innumerable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"functionaries and officers, who all, in their several spheres, represent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same powerful whole in whose name they act. The local administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thus affords an unfailing source of profit and interest to a vast number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of individuals.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The American system, which divides the local authority among so many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens, does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers. For in the United States it is believed, and with truth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that patriotism is a kind of devotion which is strengthened by ritual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observance. In this manner the activity of the township is continually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceptible; it is daily manifested in the fulfilment of a duty or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercise of a right, and a constant though gentle motion is thus kept up","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in society which animates without disturbing it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American attaches himself to his home as the mountaineer clings to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his hills, because the characteristic features of his country are there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more distinctly marked than elsewhere. The existence of the townships,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of New England is in general a happy one. Their government is suited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to their tastes, and chosen by themselves. In the midst of the profound","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peace and general comfort which reign in America the commotions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,municipal discord are unfrequent. The conduct of local business is easy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The political education of the people has long been complete; say rather,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that it was complete when the people first set foot upon the soil. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New England no tradition exists of a distinction of ranks; no portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the community is tempted to oppress the remainder; and the abuses which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may injure isolated individuals are forgotten in the general contentment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which prevails. If the government is defective (and it would no doubt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be easy to point out its deficiencies), the fact that it really emanates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from those it governs, and that it acts, either ill or well, casts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the protecting spell of a parental pride over its faults. No term of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: England formerly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governed the mass of the colonies, but the people was always sovereign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the township where its rule is not only an ancient but a primitive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The native of New England is attached to his township because it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independent and free: his co-operation in its affairs ensures his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attachment to its interest; the well-being it affords him secures his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affection; and its welfare is the aim of his ambition and of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,future exertions: he takes a part in every occurrence in the place; he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,practises the art of government in the small sphere within his reach;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he accustoms himself to those forms which can alone ensure the steady,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,progress of liberty; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a taste for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order, comprehends the union or the balance of powers, and collects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,clear practical notions on the nature of his duties and the extent of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The division of the countries in America has considerable analogy with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of the arrondissements of France. The limits of the counties are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arbitrarily laid down, and the various districts which they contain have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no necessary connection, no common tradition or natural sympathy; their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,object is simply to facilitate the administration of justice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The extent of the township was too small to contain a system of judicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions; each county has, however, a court of justice, *f a sheriff","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals. There are certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wants which are felt alike by all the townships of a county; it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore natural that they should be satisfied by a central authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the State of Massachusetts this authority is vested in the hands of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"several magistrates, who are appointed by the Governor of the State,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the advice *g of his council. *h The officers of the county have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only a limited and occasional authority, which is applicable to certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,predetermined cases. The State and the townships possess all the power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,requisite to conduct public business. The budget of the county is drawn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up by its officers, and is voted by the legislature, but there is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assembly which directly or indirectly represents the county. It has,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"by submitting to a certain dose of authority, without which they fall a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prey to anarchy. This authority may be distributed in several ways, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it must always exist somewhere.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There are two methods of diminishing the force of authority in a nation:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The first is to weaken the supreme power in its very principle, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forbidding or preventing society from acting in its own defence under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain circumstances. To weaken authority in this manner is what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally termed in Europe to lay the foundations of freedom. The second,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manner of diminishing the influence of authority does not consist in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stripping society of any of its rights, nor in paralyzing its efforts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but in distributing the exercise of its privileges in various hands,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the degree of power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessary for him to perform his duty is entrusted. There may be nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whom this distribution of social powers might lead to anarchy; but in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,itself it is not anarchical. The action of authority is indeed thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rendered less irresistible and less perilous, but it is not totally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,suppressed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The revolution of the United States was the result of a mature and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dignified taste for freedom, and not of a vague or ill-defined craving","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for independence. It contracted no alliance with the turbulent passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of anarchy; but its course was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to whatever was lawful and orderly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It was never assumed in the United States that the citizen of a free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country has a right to do whatever he pleases; on the contrary, social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obligations were there imposed upon him more various than anywhere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,else. No idea was ever entertained of attacking the principles or of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contesting the rights of society; but the exercise of its authority was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divided, to the end that the office might be powerful and the officer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insignificant, and that the community should be at once regulated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and free. In no country in the world does the law hold so absolute a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"language as in America, and in no country is the right of applying it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vested in so many hands. The administrative power in the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"presents nothing either central or hierarchical in its constitution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which accounts for its passing, unperceived. The power exists, but its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representative is not to be perceived.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,We have already seen that the independent townships of New England,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protect their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are the persons to whom the execution of the laws of the State is most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently entrusted. *i Besides the general laws, the State sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passes general police regulations; but more commonly the townships and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"town officers, conjointly with justices of the peace, regulate the minor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"details of social life, according to the necessities of the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"localities, and promulgate such enactments as concern the health of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community, and the peace as well as morality of the citizens. *j Lastly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these municipal magistrates provide, of their own accord and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"any delegated powers, for those unforeseen emergencies which frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,occur in society. *k,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It results from what we have said that in the State of Massachusetts the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administrative authority is almost entirely restricted to the township,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*l but that it is distributed among a great number of individuals.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the French commune there is properly but one official functionary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"namely, the Maire; and in New England we have seen that there are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nineteen. These nineteen functionaries do not in general depend upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one another. The law carefully prescribes a circle of action to each of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these magistrates; and within that circle they have an entire right to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perform their functions independently of any other authority. Above the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,township scarcely any trace of a series of official dignitaries is to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,found. It sometimes happens that the county officers alter a decision of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the townships or town magistrates, *m but in general the authorities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the county have no right to interfere with the authorities of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"township, *n except in such matters as concern the county.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"What, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is conducted,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and how is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,townships and their officers enforced? In the States of New England the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislative authority embraces more subjects than it does in France; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislator penetrates to the very core of the administration; the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descends to the most minute details; the same enactment prescribes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the principle and the method of its application, and thus imposes a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,multitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on the secondary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,functionaries of the State. The consequence of this is that if all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the secondary functionaries of the administration conform to the law,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society in all its branches proceeds with the greatest uniformity: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administration to conform to the law. It may be affirmed that, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general, society has only two methods of enforcing the execution of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws at its disposal: a discretionary power may be entrusted to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"superior functionary of directing all the others, and of cashiering them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in case of disobedience; or the courts of justice may be authorized to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inflict judicial penalties on the offender: but these two methods are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not always available.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The right of directing a civil officer presupposes that of cashiering,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him if he does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fulfils his duties with propriety. But an elected magistrate can neither,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be cashiered nor promoted. All elective functions are inalienable until,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their term is expired. In fact, the elected magistrate has nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,either to expect or to fear from his constituents; and when all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public offices are filled by ballot there can be no series of official,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dignities, because the double right of commanding and of enforcing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obedience can never be vested in the same individual, and because the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power of issuing an order can never be joined to that of inflicting a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,punishment or bestowing a reward.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The communities therefore in which the secondary functionaries of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the government are elected are perforce obliged to make great use of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judicial penalties as a means of administration. This is not evident at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first sight; for those in power are apt to look upon the institution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of elective functionaries as one concession, and the subjection of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the elected magistrate to the judges of the land as another. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are equally averse to both these innovations; and as they are more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they accede","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judicial power. Nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thing that can possibly counterbalance the first; and it will be found,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that an elective authority which is not subject to judicial power will,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sooner or later, either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice are the only possible medium between the central power and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administrative bodies; they alone can compel the elected functionary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to obey, without violating the rights of the elector. The extension of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judicial power in the political world ought therefore to be in the exact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ratio of the extension of elective offices: if these two institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"do not go hand in hand, the State must fall into anarchy or into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subjection.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It has always been remarked that habits of legal business do not render,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men apt to the exercise of administrative authority. The Americans have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"borrowed from the English, their fathers, the idea of an institution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is unknown upon the continent of Europe: I allude to that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Justices of the Peace. The Justice of the Peace is a sort of mezzo,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"termine between the magistrate and the man of the world, between the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civil officer and the judge. A justice of the peace is a well-informed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the knowledge of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws. His office simply obliges him to execute the police regulations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society; a task in which good sense and integrity are of more avail than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legal science. The justice introduces into the administration a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taste for established forms and publicity, which renders him a most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,blinded by those superstitions which render legal officers unfit members,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a government. The Americans have adopted the system of the English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"justices of the peace, but they have deprived it of that aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,character which is discernible in the mother-country. The Governor of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Massachusetts *p appoints a certain number of justices of the peace in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every county, whose functions last seven years. *q He further designates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,three individuals from amongst the whole body of justices who form in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,each county what is called the Court of Sessions. The justices take a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,personal share in public business; they are sometimes entrusted with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administrative functions in conjunction with elected officers, *r they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates summarily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prosecute a refractory citizen, or the citizens inform against the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abuses of the magistrate. But it is in the Court of Sessions that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise their most important functions. This court meets twice a year,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the county town; in Massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obedience of the greater number *s of public officers. *t It must be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observed, that in the State of Massachusetts the Court of Sessions is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the same time an administrative body, properly so called, and a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political tribunal. It has been asserted that the county is a purely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administrative division. The Court of Sessions presides over that small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of affairs which, as they concern several townships, or all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"townships of the county in common, cannot be entrusted to any one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them in particular. *u In all that concerns county business the duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Court of Sessions are purely administrative; and if in its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"investigations it occasionally borrows the forms of judicial procedure,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is only with a view to its own information, *v or as a guarantee to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the community over which it presides. But when the administration of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"township is brought before it, it always acts as a judicial body, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some few cases as an official assembly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote p: We shall hereafter learn what a Governor is: I shall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,difficulties are disposed of by the aid of the jury.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an authority as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,entirely independent of the general laws of the State as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,township is. We have stated that assessors are annually named by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,town-meetings to levy the taxes. If a township attempts to evade the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"payment of the taxes by neglecting to name its assessors, the Court of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Sessions condemns it to a heavy penalty. *w The fine is levied on each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the officer of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"justice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the United States the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the Government is mysteriously concealed under the forms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a judicial sentence; and its influence is at the same time fortified by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that irresistible power with which men have invested the formalities of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,law.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote w: See Act of February 20, 1786, Laws of Massachusetts, vol.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,i. p. 217.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These proceedings are easy to follow and to understand. The demands,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,made upon a township are in general plain and accurately defined; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consist in a simple fact without any complication, or in a principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without its application in detail. *x But the difficulty increases when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is not the obedience of the township, but that of the town officers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is to be enforced. All the reprehensible actions of which a public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,functionary may be guilty are reducible to the following heads:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote x: There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a township. Suppose that the funds which the law demands for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"maintenance of the roads have not been voted, the town surveyor is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then authorized, ex officio, to levy the supplies. As he is personally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"responsible to private individuals for the state of the roads, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indictable before the Court of Sessions, he is sure to employ the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extraordinary right which the law gives him against the township. Thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by threatening the officer the Court of Sessions exacts compliance from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the town. See Act of March 5, 1787, Id., vol. i. p. 305.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He may execute the law without energy or zeal;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He may neglect to execute the law;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He may do what the law enjoins him not to do.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The last two violations of duty can alone come under the cognizance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is the indispensable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foundation of an action at law. Thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the legal formalities usual at town elections, they may be condemned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to pay a fine; *y but when the public officer performs his duty without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ability, and when he obeys the letter of the law without zeal or energy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he is at least beyond the reach of judicial interference. The Court of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Sessions, even when it is invested with its official powers, is in this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obedience. The fear of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,removal is the only check to these quasi-offences; and as the Court,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Sessions does not originate the town authorities, it cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remove functionaries whom it does not appoint. Moreover, a perpetual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,investigation would be necessary to convict the officer of negligence or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lukewarmness; and the Court of Sessions sits but twice a year and then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only judges such offences as are brought before its notice. The only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,security of that active and enlightened obedience which a court of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice cannot impose upon public officers lies in the possibility of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their arbitrary removal. In France this security is sought for in powers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercised by the heads of the administration; in America it is sought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for in the principle of election.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"[Footnote y: Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been showing: If a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public officer in New England commits a crime in the exercise of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"functions, the ordinary courts of justice are always called upon to pass","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sentence upon him. If he commits a fault in his official capacity, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purely administrative tribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affair is important or urgent, the judge supplies the omission of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"functionary. *z Lastly, if the same individual is guilty of one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those intangible offences of which human justice has no cognizance, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"annually appears before a tribunal from which there is no appeal, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can at once reduce him to insignificance and deprive him of his charge.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This system undoubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attended with a practical difficulty which it is important to point out.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote z: If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its assessors, the Court of Sessions nominates them; and the magistrates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thus appointed are invested with the same authority as elected officers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"See the Act quoted above, February 20, 1787.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already observed that the administrative tribunal, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"called the Court of Sessions, has no right of inspection over the town","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,officers. It can only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,specially brought under its notice; and this is the delicate part of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,system. The Americans of New England are unacquainted with the office,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of public prosecutor in the Court of Sessions, *a and it may readily be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived that it could not have been established without difficulty.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed in the chief town of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"each county, and if he had been unassisted by agents in the townships,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he would not have been better acquainted with what was going on in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,county than the members of the Court of Sessions. But to appoint agents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in each township would have been to centre in his person the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formidable of powers, that of a judicial administration. Moreover,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws are the children of habit, and nothing of the kind exists in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation of England. The Americans have therefore divided the offices,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of inspection and of prosecution, as well as all the other functions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the administration. Grand jurors are bound by the law to apprise the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,court to which they belong of all the misdemeanors which may have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,committed in their county. *b There are certain great offences which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,officially prosecuted by the States; *c but more frequently the task of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"punishing delinquents devolves upon the fiscal officer, whose province","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is to receive the fine: thus the treasurer of the township is charged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the prosecution of such administrative offences as fall under his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,notice. But a more special appeal is made by American legislation to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the private interest of the citizen; *d and this great principle is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constantly to be met with in studying the laws of the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American legislators are more apt to give men credit for intelligence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than for honesty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the execution of the laws. When an individual is really and sensibly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"injured by an administrative abuse, it is natural that his personal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest should induce him to prosecute. But if a legal formality be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"required, which, however advantageous to the community, is of small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"importance to individuals, plaintiffs may be less easily found; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thus, by a tacit agreement, the laws may fall into disuse. Reduced by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their system to this extremity, the Americans are obliged to encourage","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,informers by bestowing on them a portion of the penalty in certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cases, *e and to insure the execution of the laws by the dangerous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expedient of degrading the morals of the people. The only administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority above the county magistrates is, properly speaking, that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote a: I say the Court of Sessions, because in common courts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,readily be imagined that in such a case it might happen that no one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cared to prosecute; hence the law adds that all the citizens may indict,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"offences of this kind, and that half of the fine shall belong to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"plaintiff. See Act of March 6, 1810, vol. ii. p. 236. The same clause","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is frequently to be met with in the law of Massachusetts. Not only are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private individuals thus incited to prosecute the public officers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but the public officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disobedience of private individuals to justice. If a citizen refuses to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perform the work which has been assigned to him upon a road, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already premised that, after having examined the constitution of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the township and the county of New England in detail, I should take","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a general view of the remainder of the Union. Townships and a local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,activity exist in every State; but in no part of the confederation is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,township to be met with precisely similar to those of New England. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more we descend towards the South, the less active does the business of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the township or parish become; the number of magistrates, of functions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of rights decreases; the population exercises a less immediate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence on affairs; town meetings are less frequent, and the subjects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of debate less numerous. The power of the elected magistrate is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"augmented and that of the elector diminished, whilst the public spirit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the local communities is less awakened and less influential. *f These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,differences may be perceived to a certain extent in the State of New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,York; they are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they become less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,striking as we advance to the northwest. The majority of the emigrants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who settle in the northwestern States are natives of New England, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they carry the habits of their mother country with them into that which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means dissimilar from a township,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in Massachusetts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Township's Treasurer, Constables, Supervisors of Highways.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,We have seen that in Massachusetts the mainspring of public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration lies in the township. It forms the common centre of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests and affections of the citizens. But this ceases to be the case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as we descend to States in which knowledge is less generally diffused,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and where the township consequently offers fewer guarantees of a wise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and active administration. As we leave New England, therefore, we find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the importance of the town is gradually transferred to the county,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which becomes the centre of administration, and the intermediate power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the Government and the citizen. In Massachusetts the business of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the county is conducted by the Court of Sessions, which is composed of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a quorum named by the Governor and his council; but the county has no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representative assembly, and its expenditure is voted by the national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislature. In the great State of New York, on the contrary, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those of Ohio and Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county choose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a certain number of representatives, who constitute the assembly of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,county. *g The county assembly has the right of taxing the inhabitants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to a certain extent; and in this respect it enjoys the privileges of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,real legislative body: at the same time it exercises an executive power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the county, frequently directs the administration of the townships,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and restricts their authority within much narrower bounds than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Massachusetts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,county as well as in that of the township.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Such are the principal differences which the systems of county and town,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration present in the Federal States. Were it my intention to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"examine the provisions of American law minutely, I should have to point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,out still further differences in the executive details of the several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,communities. But what I have already said may suffice to show the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,general principles on which the administration of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rests. These principles are differently applied; their consequences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are more or less numerous in various localities; but they are always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"substantially the same. The laws differ, and their outward features","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"change, but their character does not vary. If the township and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"county are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true that in the United States the county and the township are always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"based upon the same principle, namely, that everyone is the best judge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of what concerns himself alone, and the most proper person to supply his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,private wants. The township and the county are therefore bound to take,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"care of their special interests: the State governs, but it does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interfere with their administration. Exceptions to this rule may be met,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with, but not a contrary principle.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magistrates to be chosen either by or at least from amongst the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens. As the officers are everywhere elected or appointed for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"certain period, it has been impossible to establish the rules of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependent series of authorities; there are almost as many independent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"functionaries as there are functions, and the executive power is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disseminated in a multitude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessity of introducing the control of the courts of justice over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,secondary bodies and their representatives are constrained to obey the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws. This system obtains from one end of the Union to the other. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power of punishing the misconduct of public officers, or of performing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the part of the executive in urgent cases, has not, however, been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bestowed on the same judges in all the States. The Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derived the institution of justices of the peace from a common source;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but although it exists in all the States, it is not always turned to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same use. The justices of the peace everywhere participate in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administration of the townships and the counties, *h either as public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers or as the judges of public misdemeanors, but in most of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States the more important classes of public offences come under the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cognizance of the ordinary tribunals.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote h: In some of the Southern States the county courts are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,charged with all the details of the administration. See the Statutes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The election of public officers, or the inalienability of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of a judicial control over the secondary branches of the administration,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are the universal characteristics of the American system from Maine to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Floridas. In some States (and that of New York has advanced most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in this direction) traces of a centralized administration begin to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be discernible. In the State of New York the officers of the central,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government exercise, in certain cases, a sort of inspection or control","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over the secondary bodies. *i,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The legislative power of the State is vested in two assemblies, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first of which generally bears the name of the Senate. The Senate is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commonly a legislative body; but it sometimes becomes an executive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and judicial one. It takes a part in the government in several ways,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,according to the constitution of the different States; *m but it is in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nomination of public functionaries that it most commonly assumes an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executive power. It partakes of judicial power in the trial of certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political offences, and sometimes also in the decision of certain civil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cases. *n The number of its members is always small. The other branch of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the legislature, which is usually called the House of Representatives,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has no share whatever in the administration, and only takes a part in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the judicial power inasmuch as it impeaches public functionaries before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Senate. The members of the two Houses are nearly everywhere subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the same conditions of election. They are chosen in the same manner,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and by the same citizens. The only difference which exists between them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is, that the term for which the Senate is chosen is in general longer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than that of the House of Representatives. The latter seldom remain in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,office longer than a year; the former usually sit two or three years.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,By granting to the senators the privilege of being chosen for several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"years, and being renewed seriatim, the law takes care to preserve in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative body a nucleus of men already accustomed to public business,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and capable of exercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote m: In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administrative functions.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote n: As in the State of New York.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative body into two branches, to make one house hereditary and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other elective; one aristocratic and the other democratic. It was not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their object to create in the one a bulwark to power, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other represented the interests and passions of the people. The only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages which result from the present constitution of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States are the division of the legislative power and the consequent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,check upon political assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appeal for the revision of the laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Time and experience, however, have convinced the Americans that if these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are its only advantages, the division of the legislative power is still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a principle of the greatest necessity. Pennsylvania was the only one of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States which at first attempted to establish a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"House of Assembly, and Franklin himself was so far carried away by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessary consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as to have concurred in the measure; but the Pennsylvanians were soon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obliged to change the law, and to create two Houses. Thus the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the division of the legislative power was finally established, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its necessity may henceforward be regarded as a demonstrated truth. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"theory, which was nearly unknown to the republics of antiquity--which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was introduced into the world almost by accident, like so many other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great truths--and misunderstood by several modern nations, is at length","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The executive power of the State may with truth be said to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represented by the Governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights. The supreme magistrate, under the title of Governor, is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,official moderator and counsellor of the legislature. He is armed with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a veto or suspensive power, which allows him to stop, or at least to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retard, its movements at pleasure. He lays the wants of the country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before the legislative body, and points out the means which he thinks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation at large. *o In the absence of the legislature, the Governor is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bound to take all necessary steps to guard the State against violent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shocks and unforeseen dangers. The whole military power of the State is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the disposal of the Governor. He is the commander of the militia, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"head of the armed force. When the authority, which is by general consent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"awarded to the laws, is disregarded, the Governor puts himself at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the head of the armed force of the State, to quell resistance, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"restore order. Lastly, the Governor takes no share in the administration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of townships and counties, except it be indirectly in the nomination of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Justices of the Peace, which nomination he has not the power to cancel.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*p The Governor is an elected magistrate, and is generally chosen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,given to the Government by the community--Provincial institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more necessary in proportion as the social condition becomes more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic--Reason of this.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Centralization is become a word of general and daily use, without any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"precise meaning being attached to it. Nevertheless, there exist two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinct kinds of centralization, which it is necessary to discriminate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with accuracy. Certain interests are common to all parts of a nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,such as the enactment of its general laws and the maintenance of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreign relations. Other interests are peculiar to certain parts of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation; such, for instance, as the business of different townships. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the power which directs the general interests is centred in one place,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or vested in the same persons, it constitutes a central government.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In like manner the power of directing partial or local interests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when brought together into one place, constitutes what may be termed a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,central administration.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Upon some points these two kinds of centralization coalesce; but by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,classifying the objects which fall more particularly within the province,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of each of them, they may easily be distinguished. It is evident that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,central government acquires immense power when united to administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"centralization. Thus combined, it accustoms men to set their own will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habitually and completely aside; to submit, not only for once, or upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one point, but in every respect, and at all times. Not only, therefore,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"does this union of power subdue them compulsorily, but it affects them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the ordinary habits of life, and influences each individual, first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,separately and then collectively.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These two kinds of centralization mutually assist and attract each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other; but they must not be supposed to be inseparable. It is impossible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to imagine a more completely central government than that which existed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in France under Louis XIV.; when the same individual was the author and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the interpreter of the laws, and the representative of France at home","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and abroad, he was justified in asserting that the State was identified","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with his person. Nevertheless, the administration was much less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralized under Louis XIV. than it is at the present day.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In England the centralization of the government is carried to great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfection; the State has the compact vigor of a man, and by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sole act of its will it puts immense engines in motion, and wields or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collects the efforts of its authority. Indeed, I cannot conceive that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a nation can enjoy a secure or prosperous existence without a powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralization of government. But I am of opinion that a central,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,diminishing their public spirit. If such an administration succeeds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in condensing at a given moment, on a given point, all the disposable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources of a people, it impairs at least the renewal of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources. It may ensure a victory in the hour of strife, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gradually relaxes the sinews of strength. It may contribute admirably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the transient greatness of a man, but it cannot ensure the durable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity of a nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that a State cannot act because it has no central point, it is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralization of the government in which it is deficient. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent to the proposition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the German empire was never able to bring all its powers into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"action. But the reason was, that the State was never able to enforce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obedience to its general laws, because the several members of that great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"body always claimed the right, or found the means, of refusing their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"co-operation to the representatives of the common authority, even in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs which concerned the mass of the people; in other words, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there was no centralization of government. The same remark is applicable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the Middle Ages; the cause of all the confusion of feudal society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was that the control, not only of local but of general interests, was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divided amongst a thousand hands, and broken up in a thousand different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ways; the absence of a central government prevented the nations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europe from advancing with energy in any straightforward course.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,We have shown that in the United States no central administration and no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependent series of public functionaries exist. Local authority has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,carried to lengths which no European nation could endure without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great inconvenience, and which has even produced some disadvantageous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences in America. But in the United States the centralization,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Government is complete; and it would be easy to prove that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national power is more compact than it has ever been in the old nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Europe. Not only is there but one legislative body in each State;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not only does there exist but one source of political authority;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but district assemblies and county courts have not in general been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"multiplied, lest they should be tempted to exceed their administrative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"duties, and interfere with the Government. In America the legislature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of each State is supreme; nothing can impede its authority; neither,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"privileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"empire of reason, since it represents that majority which claims to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the sole organ of reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"limit to this action. In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"control, is the representative of the executive power, whose duty it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is to constrain the refractory to submit by superior force. The only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,symptom of weakness lies in certain details of the action of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government. The American republics have no standing armies to intimidate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"declare open war, the necessity of an army has not been felt. *q The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State usually employs the officers of the township or the county to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deal with the citizens. Thus, for instance, in New England, the assessor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fixes the rate of taxes; the collector receives them; the town-treasurer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,transmits the amount to the public treasury; and the disputes which may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arise are brought before the ordinary courts of justice. This method of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collecting taxes is slow as well as inconvenient, and it would prove a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perpetual hindrance to a Government whose pecuniary demands were large.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is desirable that, in whatever materially affects its existence, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government should be served by officers of its own, appointed by itself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"removable at pleasure, and accustomed to rapid methods of proceeding.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But it will always be easy for the central government, organized as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is in America, to introduce new and more efficacious modes of action,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proportioned to its wants. [Footnote q: [The Civil War of 1860-65,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cruelly belied this statement, and in the course of the struggle the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North alone called two millions and a half of men to arms; but to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"honor of the United States it must be added that, with the cessation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the contest, this army disappeared as rapidly as it had been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,raised.--Translator's Note.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The absence of a central government will not, then, as has often been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"asserted, prove the destruction of the republics of the New World;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,far from supposing that the American governments are not sufficiently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"centralized, I shall prove hereafter that they are too much so. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative bodies daily encroach upon the authority of the Government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and their tendency, like that of the French Convention, is to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appropriate it entirely to themselves. Under these circumstances the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"social power is constantly changing hands, because it is subordinate to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the power of the people, which is too apt to forget the maxims of wisdom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of foresight in the consciousness of its strength: hence arises its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"danger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will probably be the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cause of its ultimate destruction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The system of local administration produces several different effects in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America. The Americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of sound,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"policy in isolating the administration of the Government; for order,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"even in second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance. *r As","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State has no administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different points of its territory, to whom it can give a common impulse,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the consequence is that it rarely attempts to issue any general police,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regulations. The want of these regulations is severely felt, and is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,frequently observed by Europeans. The appearance of disorder which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevails on the surface leads him at first to imagine that society is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in a state of anarchy; nor does he perceive his mistake till he has gone,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,deeper into the subject. Certain undertakings are of importance to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole State; but they cannot be put in execution, because there is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national administration to direct them. Abandoned to the exertions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the towns or counties, under the care of elected or temporary agents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they lead to no result, or at least to no durable benefit.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote r: The authority which represents the State ought not, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"think, to waive the right of inspecting the local administration, even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when it does not interfere more actively. Suppose, for instance, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an agent of the Government was stationed at some appointed spot in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, to prosecute the misdemeanors of the town and county officers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"would not a more uniform order be the result, without in any way","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"compromising the independence of the township? Nothing of the kind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"however, exists in America: there is nothing above the county-courts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have, as it were, only an incidental cognizance of the offences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are meant to repress.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The partisans of centralization in Europe are wont to maintain that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government directs the affairs of each locality better than the citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,could do it for themselves; this may be true when the central power is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enlightened, and when the local districts are ignorant; when it is as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alert as they are slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they to obey.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Indeed, it is evident that this double tendency must augment with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increase of centralization, and that the readiness of the one and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incapacity of the others must become more and more prominent. But I deny,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that such is the case when the people is as enlightened, as awake to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests, and as accustomed to reflect on them, as the Americans are. I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the collective strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the citizens will always conduce more efficaciously to the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,welfare than the authority of the Government. It is difficult to point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"out with certainty the means of arousing a sleeping population, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"giving it passions and knowledge which it does not possess; it is, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"am well aware, an arduous task to persuade men to busy themselves about","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own affairs; and it would frequently be easier to interest them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the punctilios of court etiquette than in the repairs of their common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dwelling. But whenever a central administration affects to supersede,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the persons most interested, I am inclined to suppose that it is either","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misled or desirous to mislead. However enlightened and however skilful a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"central power may be, it cannot of itself embrace all the details of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of a great nation. Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,And when it attempts to create and set in motion so many complicated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or consume itself in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bootless efforts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Centralization succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"actions of men to a certain uniformity, which at least commands our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regard, independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,devotees who worship the statue and forget the deity it represents.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Centralization imparts without difficulty an admirable regularity to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,routine of business; provides for the details of the social police,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misdemeanors; maintains society in a status quo alike secure from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,improvement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as a sign of perfect order and public tranquillity: *s in short, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excels more in prevention than in action. Its force deserts it when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society is to be disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,co-operation of private citizens is necessary to the furtherance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. Even whilst it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"invokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they shall act","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exactly as much as the Government chooses, and exactly in the manner it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appoints. They are to take charge of the details, without aspiring to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"guide the system; they are to work in a dark and subordinate sphere, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only to judge the acts in which they have themselves cooperated by their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"results. These, however, are not conditions on which the alliance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the human will is to be obtained; its carriage must be free and its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"actions responsible, or (such is the constitution of man) the citizen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with which he is unacquainted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,[Footnote s: China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that species of well-being which a completely central administration may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,furnish to the nations among which it exists. Travellers assure us that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Chinese have peace without happiness, industry without improvement,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stability without strength, and public order without public morality.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The condition of society is always tolerable, never excellent. I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"convinced that, when China is opened to European observation, it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be found to contain the most perfect model of a central administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which exists in the universe.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is undeniable that the want of those uniform regulations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,control the conduct of every inhabitant of France is not unfrequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,felt in the United States. Gross instances of social indifference and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"neglect are to be met with, and from time to time disgraceful blemishes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are seen in complete contrast with the surrounding civilization. Useful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertakings which cannot succeed without perpetual attention and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rigorous exactitude are very frequently abandoned in the end; for in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, as well as in other countries, the people is subject to sudden","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impulses and momentary exertions. The European who is accustomed to find,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration of the townships. In general it may be affirmed that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lesser details of the police, which render life easy and comfortable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are neglected in America; but that the essential guarantees of man in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society are as strong there as elsewhere. In America the power which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conducts the Government is far less regular, less enlightened, and less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"learned, but an hundredfold more authoritative than in Europe. In no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country in the world do the citizens make such exertions for the common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weal; and I am acquainted with no people which has established schools,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as numerous and as efficacious, places of public worship better suited","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*t and the perfection of an ingenious administration, must not be sought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for in the United States; but it will be easy to find, on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hand, the symptoms of a power which, if it is somewhat barbarous, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at least robust; and of an existence which is checkered with accidents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indeed, but cheered at the same time by animation and effort.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote t: A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"drawn between the finances of France and those of the United States, has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proved that ingenuity cannot always supply the place of a knowledge of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"facts, very justly reproaches the Americans for the sort of confusion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which exists in the accounts of the expenditure in the townships; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after giving the model of a departmental budget in France, he adds:--""We","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are indebted to centralization, that admirable invention of a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"man, for the uniform order and method which prevail alike in all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"municipal budgets, from the largest town to the humblest commune.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whatever may be my admiration of this result, when I see the communes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of France, with their excellent system of accounts, plunged into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the grossest ignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when, on the other hand, I observe the activity, the information, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the spirit of enterprise which keep society in perpetual labor, in those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American townships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"still less uniformity, I am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"end of a good government is to ensure the welfare of a people, and not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to establish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distress. I am therefore led to suppose that the prosperity of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American townships and the apparent confusion of their accounts, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distress of the French communes and the perfection of their budget,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be attributable to the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"benefit which is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an evil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is compensated by so many benefits.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Granting for an instant that the villages and counties of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States would be more usefully governed by a remote authority which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they had never seen than by functionaries taken from the midst of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them--admitting, for the sake of argument, that the country would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more secure, and the resources of society better employed, if the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration centred in a single arm--still the political advantages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the Americans derive from their system would induce me to prefer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it to the contrary plan. It profits me but little, after all, that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vigilant authority should protect the tranquillity of my pleasures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and constantly avert all dangers from my path, without my care or my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"concern, if this same authority is the absolute mistress of my liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and of my life, and if it so monopolizes all the energy of existence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that when it languishes everything languishes around it, that when it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sleeps everything must sleep, that when it dies the State itself must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perish.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In certain countries of Europe the natives consider themselves as a kind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of settlers, indifferent to the fate of the spot upon which they live.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The greatest changes are effected without their concurrence and (unless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chance may have apprised them of the event) without their knowledge; nay,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more, the citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"police of his street, the repairs of the church or of the parsonage; for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself, and as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the Government. He has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only a life-interest in these possessions, and he entertains no notions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of ownership or of improvement. This want of interest in his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs goes so far that, if his own safety or that of his children is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his arms,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and wait till the nation comes to his assistance. This same individual,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who has so completely sacrificed his own free will, has no natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"propensity to obedience; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,officer; but he braves the law with the spirit of a conquered foe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as soon as its superior force is removed: his oscillations between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,servitude and license are perpetual. When a nation has arrived at this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state it must either change its customs and its laws or perish: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"source of public virtue is dry, and, though it may contain subjects,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are a natural prey to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign conquests, and if they do not disappear from the scene of life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is because they are surrounded by other nations similar or inferior,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to themselves: it is because the instinctive feeling of their country's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,claims still exists in their hearts; and because an involuntary pride in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the name it bears, or a vague reminiscence of its bygone fame, suffices","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to give them the impulse of self-preservation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nor can the prodigious exertions made by tribes in the defence of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country to which they did not belong be adduced in favor of such a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,system; for it will be found that in these cases their main incitement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was religion. The permanence, the glory, or the prosperity of the nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were become parts of their faith, and in defending the country they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabited they defended that Holy City of which they were all citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Turkish tribes have never taken an active share in the conduct of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the affairs of society, but they accomplished stupendous enterprises as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,long as the victories of the Sultan were the triumphs of the Mohammedan,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faith. In the present age they are in rapid decay, because their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religion is departing, and despotism only remains. Montesquieu, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attributed to absolute power an authority peculiar to itself, did it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as I conceive, an undeserved honor; for despotism, taken by itself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can produce no durable results. On close inspection we shall find,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that religion, and not fear, has ever been the cause of the long-lived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prosperity of an absolute government. Whatever exertions may be made, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true power can be founded among men which does not depend upon the free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,union of their inclinations; and patriotism and religion are the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two motives in the world which can permanently direct the whole of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,body politic to one end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Laws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished faith,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but men may be interested in the fate of their country by the laws. By,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this influence the vague impulse of patriotism, which never abandons the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human heart, may be directed and revived; and if it be connected with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the thoughts, the passions, and the daily habits of life, it may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consolidated into a durable and rational sentiment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Let it not be said that the time for the experiment is already past; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the old age of nations is not like the old age of men, and every fresh","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generation is a new people ready for the care of the legislator.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not the administrative but the political effects of the local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,system that I most admire in America. In the United States the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the country are everywhere kept in view; they are an object of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"solicitude to the people of the whole Union, and every citizen is as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,warmly attached to them as if they were his own. He takes pride in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"glory of his nation; he boasts of its success, to which he conceives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"himself to have contributed, and he rejoices in the general prosperity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by which he profits. The feeling he entertains towards the State is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"analogous to that which unites him to his family, and it is by a kind of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,egotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The European generally submits to a public officer because he represents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a superior force; but to an American he represents a right. In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it may be said that no one renders obedience to man, but to justice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and to law. If the opinion which the citizen entertains of himself is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exaggerated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own powers, which appear to him to be all-sufficient. When a private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual meditates an undertaking, however directly connected it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be with the welfare of society, he never thinks of soliciting the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"co-operation of the Government, but he publishes his plan, offers to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"execute it himself, courts the assistance of other individuals, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,struggles manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is often less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,successful than the State might have been in his position; but in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,end the sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government could have done.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As the administrative authority is within the reach of the citizens,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whom it in some degree represents, it excites neither their jealousy nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their hatred; as its resources are limited, every one feels that he must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not rely solely on its assistance. Thus, when the administration thinks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fit to interfere, it is not abandoned to itself as in Europe; the duties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the private citizens are not supposed to have lapsed because the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State assists in their fulfilment, but every one is ready, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, to guide and to support it. This action of individual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exertions, joined to that of the public authorities, frequently performs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,what the most energetic central administration would be unable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,execute. It would be easy to adduce several facts in proof of what I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advance, but I had rather give only one, with which I am more thoroughly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquainted. *u In America the means which the authorities have at their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of criminals are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"few. The State police does not exist, and passports are unknown. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,criminal police of the United States cannot be compared to that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"France; the magistrates and public prosecutors are not numerous, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,examinations of prisoners are rapid and oral. Nevertheless in no country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"does crime more rarely elude punishment. The reason is, that every one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conceives himself to be interested in furnishing evidence of the act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"committed, and in stopping the delinquent. During my stay in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States I witnessed the spontaneous formation of committees for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pursuit and prosecution of a man who had committed a great crime in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a certain county. In Europe a criminal is an unhappy being who is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"struggling for his life against the ministers of justice, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population is merely a spectator of the conflict; in America he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"looked upon as an enemy of the human race, and the whole of mankind is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,against him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote u: See Appendix, I.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I believe that provincial institutions are useful to all nations, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nowhere do they appear to me to be more indispensable than amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic people. In an aristocracy order can always be maintained in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the midst of liberty, and as the rulers have a great deal to lose order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is to them a first-rate consideration. In like manner an aristocracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"protects the people from the excesses of despotism, because it always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possesses an organized power ready to resist a despot. But a democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without provincial institutions has no security against these evils. How,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"can a populace, unaccustomed to freedom in small concerns, learn to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,use it temperately in great affairs? What resistance can be offered to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyranny in a country where every private individual is impotent, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,where the citizens are united by no common tie? Those who dread the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"license of the mob, and those who fear the rule of absolute power, ought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alike to desire the progressive growth of provincial liberties.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, I am convinced that democratic nations are most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exposed to fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"several reasons, amongst which is the following. The constant tendency","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of these nations is to concentrate all the strength of the Government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the hands of the only power which directly represents the people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because beyond the people nothing is to be perceived but a mass of equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individuals confounded together. But when the same power is already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in possession of all the attributes of the Government, it can scarcely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"refrain from penetrating into the details of the administration, and an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opportunity of doing so is sure to present itself in the end, as was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the case in France. In the French Revolution there were two impulses,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in opposite directions, which must never be confounded--the one was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"favorable to liberty, the other to despotism. Under the ancient monarchy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the King was the sole author of the laws, and below the power of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign certain vestiges of provincial institutions, half destroyed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were still distinguishable. These provincial institutions were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incoherent, ill compacted, and frequently absurd; in the hands of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the aristocracy they had sometimes been converted into instruments of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppression. The Revolution declared itself the enemy of royalty and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provincial institutions at the same time; it confounded all that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had preceded it--despotic power and the checks to its abuses--in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indiscriminate hatred, and its tendency was at once to overthrow and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to centralize. This double character of the French Revolution is a fact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which has been adroitly handled by the friends of absolute power. Can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they be accused of laboring in the cause of despotism when they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defending that central administration which was one of the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,innovations of the Revolution? *v In this manner popularity may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conciliated with hostility to the rights of the people, and the secret","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slave of tyranny may be the professed admirer of freedom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote v: See Appendix K.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have visited the two nations in which the system of provincial liberty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has been most perfectly established, and I have listened to the opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of different parties in those countries. In America I met with men who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,secretly aspired to destroy the democratic institutions of the Union; in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"England I found others who attacked the aristocracy openly, but I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,know of no one who does not regard provincial independence as a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,benefit. In both countries I have heard a thousand different causes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assigned for the evils of the State, but the local system was never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mentioned amongst them. I have heard citizens attribute the power and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prosperity of their country to a multitude of reasons, but they all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,placed the advantages of local institutions in the foremost rank. Am,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I to suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinions and on political theories agree on one point (and that one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of which they have daily experience), they are all in error? The only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations which deny the utility of provincial liberties are those which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have fewest of them; in other words, those who are unacquainted with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institution are the only persons who pass a censure upon it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of them. Confederations have existed in other countries beside America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and republics have not been established upon the shores of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,World alone; the representative system of government has been adopted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in several States of Europe, but I am not aware that any nation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the globe has hitherto organized a judicial power on the principle now,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adopted by the Americans. The judicial organization of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is the institution which a stranger has the greatest difficulty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in understanding. He hears the authority of a judge invoked in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political occurrences of every day, and he naturally concludes that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the United States the judges are important political functionaries;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nevertheless, when he examines the nature of the tribunals, they offer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nothing which is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bodies, and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of chance, but by a chance which recurs every day.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the Parliament of Paris remonstrated, or refused to enregister an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"edict, or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bar, its political influence as a judicial body was clearly visible; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States. The Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have retained all the ordinary characteristics of judicial authority,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and have carefully restricted its action to the ordinary circle of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,functions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The first characteristic of judicial power in all nations is the duty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of arbitration. But rights must be contested in order to warrant the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interference of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decision of a judge. As long, therefore, as the law is uncontested, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judicial authority is not called upon to discuss it, and it may exist","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without being perceived. When a judge in a given case attacks a law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"relating to that case, he extends the circle of his customary duties,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without however stepping beyond it; since he is in some measure obliged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to decide upon the law in order to decide the case. But if he pronounces,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon a law without resting upon a case, he clearly steps beyond his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sphere, and invades that of the legislative authority.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The second characteristic of judicial power is that it pronounces on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"special cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge in deciding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a particular point destroys a general principle, by passing a judgment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,functions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have agreed to confine his authority, he assumes a more important, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perhaps a more useful, influence than that of the magistrate, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ceases to be a representative of the judicial power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability to act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affair. This characteristic is less general than the other two; but,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"notwithstanding the exceptions, I think it may be regarded as essential.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The judicial power is by its nature devoid of action; it must be put in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,motion in order to produce a result. When it is called upon to repress a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crime, it punishes the criminal; when a wrong is to be redressed, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ready to redress it; when an act requires interpretation, it is prepared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to interpret it; but it does not pursue criminals, hunt out wrongs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or examine into evidence of its own accord. A judicial functionary who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"should open proceedings, and usurp the censorship of the laws, would in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some measure do violence to the passive nature of his authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the judicial power; an American judge can only pronounce a decision,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when litigation has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,court. His position is therefore perfectly similar to that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magistrate of other nations; and he is nevertheless invested with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,immense political power. If the sphere of his authority and his means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"action are the same as those of other judges, it may be asked whence he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derives a power which they do not possess. The cause of this difference,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lies in the simple fact that the Americans have acknowledged the right,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the judges to found their decisions on the constitution rather than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on the laws. In other words, they have left them at liberty not to apply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,such laws as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am aware that a similar right has been claimed--but claimed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vain--by courts of justice in other countries; but in America it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recognized by all authorities; and not a party, nor so much as an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual, is found to contest it. This fact can only be explained by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the principles of the American constitution. In France the constitution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is (or at least is supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that no power has the right of changing any part of it. In England the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Parliament has an acknowledged right to modify the constitution; as,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, the constitution may undergo perpetual changes, it does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not in reality exist; the Parliament is at once a legislative and a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constituent assembly. The political theories of America are more simple,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immutable as in France, nor is it susceptible of modification by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ordinary powers of society as in England. It constitutes a detached,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole, which, as it represents the determination of the whole people, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which may be altered by the will of the people in predetermined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cases, according to established rules. In America the constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may therefore vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force. *a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: [The fifth article of the original Constitution of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States provides the mode in which amendments of the Constitution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be made. Amendments must be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several States. Fifteen amendments of the Constitution have been made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at different times since 1789, the most important of which are the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, framed and ratified after the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Civil War. The original Constitution of the United States, followed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by these fifteen amendments, is printed at the end of this edition.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"--Translator's Note, 1874.]]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the position and the rights of the judicial bodies in the three,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,countries I have cited. If in France the tribunals were authorized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to disobey the laws on the ground of their being opposed to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution, the supreme power would in fact be placed in their hands,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"since they alone would have the right of interpreting a constitution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the clauses of which can be modified by no authority. They would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore take the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would allow them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are incompetent to declare a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"law to be unconstitutional, the power of changing the constitution is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indirectly given to the legislative body, since no legal barrier would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppose the alterations which it might prescribe. But it is better to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,grant the power of changing the constitution of the people to men who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represent (however imperfectly) the will of the people, than to men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represent no one but themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It would be still more unreasonable to invest the English judges with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the right of resisting the decisions of the legislative body, since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Parliament which makes the laws also makes the constitution; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently a law emanating from the three powers of the State can in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no case be unconstitutional. But neither of these remarks is applicable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to America.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States the constitution governs the legislator as much as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the private citizen; as it is the first of laws it cannot be modified,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by a law, and it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constitution in preference to any law. This condition is essential to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the power of the judicature, for to select that legal obligation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by which he is most strictly bound is the natural right of every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magistrate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In France the constitution is also the first of laws, and the judges","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have the same right to take it as the ground of their decisions, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were they to exercise this right they must perforce encroach on rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more sacred than their own, namely, on those of society, in whose name","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are acting. In this case the State-motive clearly prevails over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"motives of an individual. In America, where the nation can always reduce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its magistrates to obedience by changing its constitution, no danger of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this kind is to be feared. Upon this point, therefore, the political and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the logical reasons agree, and the people as well as the judges preserve","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their privileges.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is argued,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in a tribunal of the United States he may refuse to admit it as a rule;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this power is the only one which is peculiar to the American magistrate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but it gives rise to immense political influence. Few laws can escape,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the searching analysis of the judicial power for any length of time,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for there are few which are not prejudicial to some private interest or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other, and none which may not be brought before a court of justice by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the choice of parties, or by the necessity of the case. But from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time that a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,loses a portion of its moral cogency. The persons to whose interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is prejudicial learn that means exist of evading its authority, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. One of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two alternatives must then be resorted to: the people must alter the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution, or the legislature must repeal the law. The political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power which the Americans have intrusted to their courts of justice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is therefore immense, but the evils of this power are considerably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,diminished by the obligation which has been imposed of attacking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws through the courts of justice alone. If the judge had been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"empowered to contest the laws on the ground of theoretical generalities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a censure on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislator, he would have played a prominent part in the political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sphere; and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he would have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arrayed the hostile passions of the nation in the conflict. But when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a judge contests a law applied to some particular case in an obscure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proceeding, the importance of his attack is concealed from the public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gaze, his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the law is slighted it is only collaterally. Moreover, although it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its cogency is by no means suspended, and its final destruction can only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will readily be understood that by connecting the censorship of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws with the private interests of members of the community, and by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intimately uniting the prosecution of the law with the prosecution of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an individual, legislation is protected from wanton assailants, and from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the daily aggressions of party spirit. The errors of the legislator are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exposed whenever their evil consequences are most felt, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,always a positive and appreciable fact which serves as the basis of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosecution.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,once the most favorable to liberty as well as to public order. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judge could only attack the legislator openly and directly, he would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sometimes be afraid to oppose any resistance to his will; and at other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,moments party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The laws would consequently be attacked when the power from which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"emanate is weak, and obeyed when it is strong. That is to say, when it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"would be useful to respect them they would be contested, and when it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be easy to convert them into an instrument of oppression they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be respected. But the American judge is brought into the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arena independently of his own will. He only judges the law because he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is obliged to judge a case. The political question which he is called,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon to resolve is connected with the interest of the suitors, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot refuse to decide it without abdicating the duties of his post.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He performs his functions as a citizen by fulfilling the precise duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which belong to his profession as a magistrate. It is true that upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this system the judicial censorship which is exercised by the courts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"justice over the legislation cannot extend to all laws indiscriminately,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inasmuch as some of them can never give rise to that exact species,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and even when such a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contestation is possible, it may happen that no one cares to bring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it before a court of justice. The Americans have often felt this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"disadvantage, but they have left the remedy incomplete, lest they should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,give it an efficacy which might in some cases prove dangerous. Within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these limits the power vested in the American courts of justice of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pronouncing a statute to be unconstitutional forms one of the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powerful barriers which has ever been devised against the tyranny of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political assemblies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Other Powers Granted To American Judges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The United States all the citizens have the right of indicting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public functionaries before the ordinary tribunals--How they use this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right--Art. 75 of the French Constitution of the An VIII--The Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the English cannot understand the purport of this clause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens should have the right of indicting public functionaries before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges should have the power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,punishing public offences. The right granted to the courts of justice of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judging the agents of the executive government, when they have violated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the laws, is so natural a one that it cannot be looked upon as an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extraordinary privilege. Nor do the springs of government appear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,me to be weakened in the United States by the custom which renders all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public officers responsible to the judges of the land. The Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that respect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is due to the authorities, and at the same time to have rendered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those who are in power more scrupulous of offending public opinion. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was struck by the small number of political trials which occur in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States, but I had no difficulty in accounting for this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstance. A lawsuit, of whatever nature it may be, is always a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficult and expensive undertaking. It is easy to attack a public man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a journal, but the motives which can warrant an action at law must be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,serious. A solid ground of complaint must therefore exist to induce,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an individual to prosecute a public officer, and public officers are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,careful not to furnish these grounds of complaint when they are afraid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of being prosecuted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This does not depend upon the republican form of American institutions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the same facts present themselves in England. These two nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,do not regard the impeachment of the principal officers of State as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sufficient guarantee of their independence. But they hold that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"right of minor prosecutions, which are within the reach of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community, is a better pledge of freedom than those great judicial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,actions which are rarely employed until it is too late.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the Middle Ages, when it was very difficult to overtake offenders,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the judges inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arrested, which by no means diminished the number of crimes. It has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"since been discovered that when justice is more certain and more mild,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is at the same time more efficacious. The English and the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hold that tyranny and oppression are to be treated like any other crime,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by lessening the penalty and facilitating conviction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the year VIII of the French Republic a constitution was drawn up in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which the following clause was introduced: ""Art. 75. All the agents of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the government below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offences relating to their several functions by virtue of a decree of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Conseil d'Etat; in which the case the prosecution takes place before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ordinary tribunals."" This clause survived the ""Constitution de l'An","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"VIII,"" and it is still maintained in spite of the just complaints of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nation. I have always found the utmost difficulty in explaining its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,meaning to Englishmen or Americans. They were at once led to conclude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the Conseil d'Etat in France was a great tribunal, established in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the centre of the kingdom, which exercised a preliminary and somewhat","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tyrannical jurisdiction in all political causes. But when I told them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the Conseil d'Etat was not a judicial body, in the common sense of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the term, but an administrative council composed of men dependent on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Crown, so that the king, after having ordered one of his servants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"called a Prefect, to commit an injustice, has the power of commanding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"another of his servants, called a Councillor of State, to prevent the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former from being punished; when I demonstrated to them that the citizen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who has been injured by the order of the sovereign is obliged to solicit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the sovereign permission to obtain redress, they refused to credit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so flagrant an abuse, and were tempted to accuse me of falsehood or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of ignorance. It frequently happened before the Revolution that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Parliament issued a warrant against a public officer who had committed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an offence, and sometimes the proceedings were stopped by the authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Crown, which enforced compliance with its absolute and despotic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will. It is painful to perceive how much lower we are sunk than our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forefathers, since we allow things to pass under the color of justice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,penalty--Political jurisdiction as it exists in the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is, notwithstanding its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mildness, a most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,invested.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In absolute governments no utility can accrue from the introduction of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extraordinary forms of procedure; the prince in whose name an offender,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is prosecuted is as much the sovereign of the courts of justice as of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"everything else, and the idea which is entertained of his power is of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself a sufficient security. The only thing he has to fear is, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the external formalities of justice should be neglected, and that his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority should be dishonored from a wish to render it more absolute.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But in most free countries, in which the majority can never exercise the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same influence upon the tribunals as an absolute monarch, the judicial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power has occasionally been vested for a time in the representatives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation. It has been thought better to introduce a temporary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confusion between the functions of the different authorities than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,violate the necessary principle of the unity of government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"England, France, and the United States have established this political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jurisdiction by law; and it is curious to examine the different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adaptations which these three great nations have made of the principle.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In England and in France the House of Lords and the Chambre des Paris *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitute the highest criminal court of their respective nations, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"although they do not habitually try all political offences, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,competent to try them all. Another political body enjoys the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impeachment before the House of Lords: the only difference which exists,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"between the two countries in this respect is, that in England the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Commons may impeach whomsoever they please before the Lords, whilst in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,France the Deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ministers of the Crown.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: [As it existed under the constitutional monarchy down to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,1848.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In both countries the Upper House may make use of all the existing penal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws of the nation to punish the delinquents.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislature is authorized to impeach and another to judge: the House,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Representatives arraigns the offender, and the Senate awards his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sentence. But the Senate can only try such persons as are brought before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it by the House of Representatives, and those persons must belong to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,class of public functionaries. Thus the jurisdiction of the Senate is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less extensive than that of the Peers of France, whilst the right of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impeachment by the Representatives is more general than that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Deputies. But the great difference which exists between Europe and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America is, that in Europe political tribunals are empowered to inflict","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the dispositions of the penal code, while in America, when they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have deprived the offender of his official rank, and have declared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him incapable of filling any political office for the future, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jurisdiction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals begins.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Suppose, for instance, that the President of the United States has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,committed the crime of high treason; the House of Representatives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impeaches him, and the Senate degrades him; he must then be tried by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a jury, which alone can deprive him of his liberty or his life. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accurately illustrates the subject we are treating. The political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jurisdiction which is established by the laws of Europe is intended to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"try great offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powers in the State; and to this end all the privileges of the courts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of justice are temporarily extended to a great political assembly. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislator is then transformed into the magistrate; he is called upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to admit, to distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he exercises","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the authority of a judge, the law restricts him to the observance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of all the duties of that high office, and of all the formalities of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice. When a public functionary is impeached before an English or a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"French political tribunal, and is found guilty, the sentence deprives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him ipso facto of his functions, and it may pronounce him to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incapable of resuming them or any others for the future. But in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"case the political interdict is a consequence of the sentence, and not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the sentence itself. In Europe the sentence of a political tribunal is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be regarded as a judicial verdict rather than as an administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measure. In the United States the contrary takes place; and although the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decision of the Senate is judicial in its form, since the Senators","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are obliged to comply with the practices and formalities of a court of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice; although it is judicial in respect to the motives on which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is founded, since the Senate is in general obliged to take an offence at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,common law as the basis of its sentence; nevertheless the object of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proceeding is purely administrative. If it had been the intention of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American legislator to invest a political body with great judicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, its action would not have been limited to the circle of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public functionaries, since the most dangerous enemies of the State may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be in the possession of no functions at all; and this is especially true,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in republics, where party influence is the first of authorities, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,where the strength of many a reader is increased by his exercising no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legal power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If it had been the intention of the American legislator to give,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society the means of repressing State offences by exemplary punishment,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"according to the practice of ordinary justice, the resources of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,penal code would all have been placed at the disposal of the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tribunals. But the weapon with which they are intrusted is an imperfect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one, and it can never reach the most dangerous offenders, since men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aim at the entire subversion of the laws are not likely to murmur at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political interdict.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The main object of the political jurisdiction which obtains in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States is, therefore, to deprive the ill-disposed citizen of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an authority which he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquiring it again. This is evidently an administrative measure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sanctioned by the formalities of a judicial decision. In this matter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Americans have created a mixed system; they have surrounded the act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which removes a public functionary with the securities of a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,trial; and they have deprived all political condemnations of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,severest penalties. Every link of the system may easily be traced from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this point; we at once perceive why the American constitutions subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the civil functionaries to the jurisdiction of the Senate, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the military, whose crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exempted from that tribunal. In the civil service none of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,functionaries can be said to be removable; the places which some of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them occupy are inalienable, and the others are chosen for a term which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be shortened. It is therefore necessary to try them all in order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to deprive them of their authority. But military officers are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dependent on the chief magistrate of the State, who is himself a civil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"functionary, and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If we now compare the American and the European systems, we shall meet","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with differences no less striking in the different effects which each of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them produces or may produce. In France and in England the jurisdiction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of political bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is only to be employed in order to rescue society from unwonted dangers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they are constituted in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe, are apt to violate the conservative principle of the balance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power in the State, and to threaten incessantly the lives and liberties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the subject. The same political jurisdiction in the United States is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only indirectly hostile to the balance of power; it cannot menace the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lives of the citizens, and it does not hover, as in Europe, over the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heads of the community, since those only who have submitted to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority on accepting office are exposed to the severity of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,investigations. It is at the same time less formidable and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"efficacious; indeed, it has not been considered by the legislators of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States as a remedy for the more violent evils of society, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as an ordinary means of conducting the government. In this respect it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,probably exercises more real influence on the social body in America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than in Europe. We must not be misled by the apparent mildness of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American legislation in all that relates to political jurisdiction. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is to be observed, in the first place, that in the United States the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tribunal which passes sentence is composed of the same elements,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and subject to the same influences, as the body which impeaches the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"offender, and that this uniformity gives an almost irresistible impulse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the vindictive passions of parties. If political judges in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States cannot inflict such heavy penalties as those of Europe, there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the less chance of their acquitting a prisoner; and the conviction,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if it is less formidable, is more certain. The principal object of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political tribunals of Europe is to punish the offender; the purpose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of those in America is to deprive him of his authority. A political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condemnation in the United States may, therefore, be looked upon as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preventive measure; and there is no reason for restricting the judges to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the exact definitions of criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the excessive latitude with which political offences are described in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the laws of America. Article II., Section 4, of the Constitution of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States runs thus:--""The President, Vice-President, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crimes and misdemeanors."" Many of the Constitutions of the States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are even less explicit. ""Public officers,"" says the Constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Massachusetts, *b ""shall be impeached for misconduct or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"maladministration;"" the Constitution of Virginia declares that all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the civil officers who shall have offended against the State, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"maladministration, corruption, or other high crimes, may be impeached by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the House of Delegates; in some constitutions no offences are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"specified, in order to subject the public functionaries to an unlimited","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsibility. *c But I will venture to affirm that it is precisely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their mildness which renders the American laws most formidable in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,respect. We have shown that in Europe the removal of a functionary and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his political interdiction are the consequences of the penalty he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to undergo, and that in America they constitute the penalty itself.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The consequence is that in Europe political tribunals are invested with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights which they are afraid to use, and that the fear of punishing too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,much hinders them from punishing at all. But in America no one hesitates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to inflict a penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To condemn a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political opponent to death, in order to deprive him of his power, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to commit what all the world would execrate as a horrible assassination;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but to declare that opponent unworthy to exercise that authority, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deprive him of it, and to leave him uninjured in life and limb, may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judged to be the fair issue of the struggle. But this sentence, which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is so easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally severe to the majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of those upon whom it is inflicted. Great criminals may undoubtedly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"brave its intangible rigor, but ordinary offenders will dread it as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condemnation which destroys their position in the world, casts a blight","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon their honor, and condemns them to a shameful inactivity worse than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,death. The influence exercised in the United States upon the progress,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of society by the jurisdiction of political bodies may not appear to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formidable, but it is only the more immense. It does not directly coerce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the subject, but it renders the majority more absolute over those in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power; it does not confer an unbounded authority on the legislator which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"can be exerted at some momentous crisis, but it establishes a temperate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and regular influence, which is at all times available. If the power is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decreased, it can, on the other hand, be more conveniently employed and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more easily abused. By preventing political tribunals from inflicting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judicial punishments the Americans seem to have eluded the worst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am not sure that political jurisdiction, as it is constituted in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States, is not the most formidable weapon which has ever been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,placed in the rude grasp of a popular majority. When the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republics begin to degenerate it will be easy to verify the truth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this observation, by remarking whether the number of political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impeachments augments.*d,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"England towards the end of the last century professed, as I have already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observed, the same religion, the same language, the same customs, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost the same laws; they were struggling against a common enemy; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these reasons were sufficiently strong to unite them one to another, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to consolidate them into one nation. But as each of them had enjoyed a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"separate existence and a government within its own control, the peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests and customs which resulted from this system were opposed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a compact and intimate union which would have absorbed the individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,importance of each in the general importance of all. Hence arose two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opposite tendencies, the one prompting the Anglo-Americans to unite,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the other to divide their strength. As long as the war with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mother-country lasted the principle of union was kept alive by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"necessity; and although the laws which constituted it were defective,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the common tie subsisted in spite of their imperfections. *a But no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sooner was peace concluded than the faults of the legislation became,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manifest, and the State seemed to be suddenly dissolved. Each colony","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"became an independent republic, and assumed an absolute sovereignty. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"federal government, condemned to impotence by its constitution, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no longer sustained by the presence of a common danger, witnessed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"outrages offered to its flag by the great nations of Europe, whilst it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was scarcely able to maintain its ground against the Indian tribes, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to pay the interest of the debt which had been contracted during the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"war of independence. It was already on the verge of destruction, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it officially proclaimed its inability to conduct the government, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appealed to the constituent authority of the nation. *b If America ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,approached (for however brief a time) that lofty pinnacle of glory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to which the fancy of its inhabitants is wont to point, it was at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"solemn moment at which the power of the nation abdicated, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the empire of the land. All ages have furnished the spectacle of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people struggling with energy to win its independence; and the efforts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Americans in throwing off the English yoke have been considerably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exaggerated. Separated from their enemies by three thousand miles of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ocean, and backed by a powerful ally, the success of the United States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be more justly attributed to their geographical position than to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,valor of their armies or the patriotism of their citizens. It would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be ridiculous to compare the American was to the wars of the French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Revolution, or the efforts of the Americans to those of the French when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they were attacked by the whole of Europe, without credit and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"allies, yet capable of opposing a twentieth part of their population to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the world, and of bearing the torch of revolution beyond their frontiers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst they stifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country. But it is a novelty in the history of society to see a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people turn a calm and scrutinizing eye upon itself, when apprised by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the legislature that the wheels of government are stopped; to see it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"carefully examine the extent of the evil, and patiently wait for two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole years until a remedy was discovered, which it voluntarily adopted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without having wrung a tear or a drop of blood from mankind. At the time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when the inadequacy of the first constitution was discovered America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possessed the double advantage of that calm which had succeeded the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effervescence of the revolution, and of those great men who had led the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,revolution to a successful issue. The assembly which accepted the task,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of composing the second constitution was small; *c but George Washington,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was its President, and it contained the choicest talents and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,noblest hearts which had ever appeared in the New World. This national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commission, after long and mature deliberation, offered to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acceptance of the people the body of general laws which still rules,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union. All the States adopted it successively. *d The new Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government commenced its functions in 1789, after an interregnum of two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The first question which awaited the Americans was intricate, and by no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means easy of solution: the object was so to divide the authority of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the different States which composed the Union that each of them should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continue to govern itself in all that concerned its internal prosperity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whilst the entire nation, represented by the Union, should continue to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form a compact body, and to provide for the general exigencies of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people. It was as impossible to determine beforehand, with any degree","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of accuracy, the share of authority which each of two governments was to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enjoy, as to foresee all the incidents in the existence of a nation.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The obligations and the claims of the Federal Government were simple,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and easily definable, because the Union had been formed with the express","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,purpose of meeting the general exigencies of the people; but the claims,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and obligations of the States were, on the other hand, complicated and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"various, because those Governments had penetrated into all the details","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of social life. The attributes of the Federal Government were therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,carefully enumerated and all that was not included amongst them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was declared to constitute a part of the privileges of the several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Governments of the States. Thus the government of the States remained,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the rule, and that of the Confederation became the exception. *e","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,at liberty to make a law for itself. This point has been established by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,a national Government was less imperiously felt in the conduct of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,internal policy of society; but there are certain general interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which can only be attended to with advantage by a general authority. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union was invested with the power of controlling the monetary system, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"predetermined cases, in which an indiscreet abuse of their independence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the power of modifying and changing their legislation at pleasure was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,In examining the balance of power as established by the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution; in remarking on the one hand the portion of sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which has been reserved to the several States, and on the other the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"share of power which the Union has assumed, it is evident that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal legislators entertained the clearest and most accurate notions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on the nature of the centralization of government. The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form not only a republic, but a confederation; nevertheless the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarchies of Europe when the American Constitution was formed. Take,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for instance, the two following examples.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thirteen supreme courts of justice existed in France, which, generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speaking, had the right of interpreting the law without appeal; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those provinces which were styled pays d'etats were authorized to refuse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their assent to an impost which had been levied by the sovereign who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represented the nation. In the Union there is but one tribunal to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interpret, as there is one legislature to make the laws; and an impost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,voted by the representatives of the nation is binding upon all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens. In these two essential points, therefore, the Union exercises","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more central authority than the French monarchy possessed, although the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union is only an assemblage of confederate republics.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a system of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"custom-house duties peculiar to themselves, although that privilege","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"belongs, by its very nature, to the national sovereignty. In America the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Congress alone has the right of regulating the commercial relations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the States. The government of the Confederation is therefore more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralized in this respect than the kingdom of Spain. It is true that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the power of the Crown in France or in Spain was always able to obtain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by force whatever the Constitution of the country denied, and that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The plan which had been laid down beforehand for the Constitutions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the several States was followed, in many points, in the organization","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the powers of the Union. The Federal legislature of the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. A spirit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conciliation prescribed the observance of distinct principles in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the formation of these two assemblies. I have already shown that two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contrary interests were opposed to each other in the establishment of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Federal Constitution. These two interests had given rise to two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinions. It was the wish of one party to convert the Union into a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"league of independent States, or a sort of congress, at which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of the several peoples would meet to discuss certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,points of their common interests. The other party desired to unite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the inhabitants of the American colonies into one sole nation, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,establish a Government which should act as the sole representative of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the nation, as far as the limited sphere of its authority would permit.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The practical consequences of these two theories were exceedingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The question was, whether a league was to be established instead of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"national Government; whether the majority of the State, instead of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority of the inhabitants of the Union, was to give the law: for every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State, the small as well as the great, would then remain in the full","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enjoyment of its independence, and enter the Union upon a footing of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfect equality. If, however, the inhabitants of the United States were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be considered as belonging to one and the same nation, it would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,just that the majority of the citizens of the Union should prescribe the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,law. Of course the lesser States could not subscribe to the application,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this doctrine without, in fact, abdicating their existence in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relation to the sovereignty of the Confederation; since they would have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passed from the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative authority to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of an insignificant fraction of a great people. But if the former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"system would have invested them with an excessive authority, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter would have annulled their influence altogether. Under these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances the result was, that the strict rules of logic were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"evaded, as is usually the case when interests are opposed to arguments.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A middle course was hit upon by the legislators, which brought together","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by force two systems theoretically irreconcilable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The principle of the independence of the States prevailed in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formation of the Senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,predominated in the composition of the House of Representatives. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was decided that each State should send two senators to Congress, and a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,number of representatives proportioned to its population. *n It results,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from this arrangement that the State of New York has at the present day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forty representatives and only two senators; the State of Delaware,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has two senators and only one representative; the State of Delaware,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is therefore equal to the State of New York in the Senate, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter has forty times the influence of the former in the House of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Representatives. Thus, if the minority of the nation preponderates in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Senate,. it may paralyze the decisions of the majority represented","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the other House, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote n: Every ten years Congress fixes anew the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives which each State is to furnish. The total number was 69,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in 1789, and 240 in 1833. (See ""American Almanac,"" 1834, p. 194.)","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution decided that there should not be more than one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representative for every 30,000 persons; but no minimum was fixed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on. The Congress has not thought fit to augment the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives in proportion to the increase of population. The first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Act which was passed on the subject (April 14, 1792: see ""Laws of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States,"" by Story, vol. i. p. 235) decided that there should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. The last Act, which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passed in 1832, fixes the proportion at one for 48,000. The population","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represented is composed of all the free men and of three-fifths of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slaves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[The last Act of apportionment, passed February 2, 1872, fixes the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. There are now (1875) 283","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"members of the lower House of Congress, and 9 for the States at large,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,making in all 292 members. The old States have of course lost the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives which the new States have gained.--Translator's Note.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,logically to combine all the several parts of legislation. In the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"course of time different interests arise, and different principles are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sanctioned by the same people; and when a general constitution is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be established, these interests and principles are so many natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obstacles to the rigorous application of any political system, with all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its consequences. The early stages of national existence are the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,periods at which it is possible to maintain the complete logic of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantage, before we hasten to conclude that it is wise, we should do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,well to remember that it is young. When the Federal Constitution was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed, the interests of independence for the separate States, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest of union for the whole people, were the only two conflicting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests which existed amongst the Anglo-Americans, and a compromise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was necessarily made between them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the Constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has not hitherto produced those evils which might have been feared. All,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the States are young and contiguous; their customs, their ideas, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their exigencies are not dissimilar; and the differences which result,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from their size or inferiority do not suffice to set their interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at variance. The small States have consequently never been induced to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,league themselves together in the Senate to oppose the designs of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,larger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an authority in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legitimate expression of the will of a people that the Senate could,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the House,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Representatives.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power of the American legislators to reduce to a single nation the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people for whom they were making laws. The object of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution was not to destroy the independence of the States, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to restrain it. By acknowledging the real authority of these secondary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"communities (and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduction of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of the States into the mechanism of the Federal Government was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by no means to be wondered at, since it only attested the existence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,nevertheless sufficiently strong to act without restraint in its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sphere. It was indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of government that the representative of the executive power should be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subject to the will of the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The President is an elective magistrate. His honor, his property, his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,temperate use of his power. But in the exercise of his authority he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be said to be perfectly independent; the Senate takes cognizance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,means of corruption. The legislators of the Union acknowledged that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executive power would be incompetent to fulfil its task with dignity and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"utility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of stability and of strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"executive power of the Union, and care was taken not to render his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decisions subordinate to the vote of a council--a dangerous measure,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which tends at the same time to clog the action of the Government and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to diminish its responsibility. The Senate has the right of annulling,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,g certain acts of the President; but it cannot compel him to take any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"steps, nor does it participate in the exercise of the executive power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The action of the legislature on the executive power may be direct; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we have just shown that the Americans carefully obviated this influence;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but it may, on the other hand, be indirect. Public assemblies which have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the power of depriving an officer of state of his salary encroach upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his independence; and as they are free to make the laws, it is to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,feared lest they should gradually appropriate to themselves a portion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of that authority which the Constitution had vested in his hands. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependence of the executive power is one of the defects inherent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republican constitutions. The Americans have not been able to counteract,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the tendency which legislative assemblies have to get possession of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, but they have rendered this propensity less irresistible.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The salary of the President is fixed, at the time of his entering","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon office, for the whole period of his magistracy. The President is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moreover, provided with a suspensive veto, which allows him to oppose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the passing of such laws as might destroy the portion of independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the Constitution awards him. The struggle between the President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the legislature must always be an unequal one, since the latter is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain of bearing down all resistance by persevering in its plans; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the suspensive veto forces it at least to reconsider the matter, and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if the motion be persisted in, it must then be backed by a majority of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"two-thirds of the whole house. The veto is, in fact, a sort of appeal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the people. The executive power, which, without this security, might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have been secretly oppressed, adopts this means of pleading its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cause and stating its motives. But if the legislature is certain of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"overpowering all resistance by persevering in its plans, I reply, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the constitutions of all nations, of whatever kind they may be, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain point exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the good sense and the virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more prominent and more discoverable in republics, whilst it is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remote and more carefully concealed in monarchies, but it always exists","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,somewhere. There is no country in the world in which everything can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The executive power has so important an influence on the destinies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations that I am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"my subject, in order more clearly to explain the part it sustains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in America. In order to form an accurate idea of the position of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"President of the United States, it may not be irrelevant to compare it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to that of one of the constitutional kings of Europe. In this comparison,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I shall pay but little attention to the external signs of power, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are more apt to deceive the eye of the observer than to guide his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,researches. When a monarchy is being gradually transformed into a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republic, the executive power retains the titles, the honors, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"etiquette, and even the funds of royalty long after its authority has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"disappeared. The English, after having cut off the head of one king","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and expelled another from his throne, were accustomed to accost the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"successor of those princes upon their knees. On the other hand, when a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republic falls under the sway of a single individual, the demeanor of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the sovereign is simple and unpretending, as if his authority was not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,yet paramount. When the emperors exercised an unlimited control over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the fortunes and the lives of their fellow-citizens, it was customary to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"call them Caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of supping","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without formality at their friends' houses. It is therefore necessary to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,look below the surface.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The sovereignty of the United States is shared between the Union and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, whilst in France it is undivided and compact: hence arises the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first and the most notable difference which exists between the President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the United States and the King of France. In the United States the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executive power is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union in whose name it acts; in France it is as universal as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the State. The Americans have a federal and the French a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national Government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part II,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This cause of inferiority results from the nature of things, but it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not the only one; the second in importance is as follows: Sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be defined to be the right of making laws: in France, the King","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"really exercises a portion of the sovereign power, since the laws have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no weight till he has given his assent to them; he is, moreover, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executor of all they ordain. The President is also the executor of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws, but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,refusal of his assent does not annul them. He is therefore merely to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,considered as the agent of the sovereign power. But not only does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the King of France exercise a portion of the sovereign power, he also","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other portion. He has the privilege of appointing the members of one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"chamber, and of dissolving the other at his pleasure; whereas the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,President of the United States has no share in the formation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative body, and cannot dissolve any part of it. The King has the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same right of bringing forward measures as the Chambers; a right which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the President does not possess. The King is represented in each assembly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by his ministers, who explain his intentions, support his opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and maintain the principles of the Government. The President and his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ministers are alike excluded from Congress; so that his influence and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his opinions can only penetrate indirectly into that great body. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"King of France is therefore on an equal footing with the legislature,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which can no more act without him than he can without it. The President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercises an authority inferior to, and depending upon, that of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Even in the exercise of the executive power, properly so called--the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,point upon which his position seems to be most analogous to that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the King of France--the President labors under several causes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inferiority. The authority of the King, in France, has, in the first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"place, the advantage of duration over that of the President, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,durability is one of the chief elements of strength; nothing is either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,loved or feared but what is likely to endure. The President of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States is a magistrate elected for four years; the King, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"France, is an hereditary sovereign. In the exercise of the executive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power the President of the United States is constantly subject to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"jealous scrutiny. He may make, but he cannot conclude, a treaty; he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may designate, but he cannot appoint, a public officer. *q The King of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,France is absolute within the limits of his authority. The President of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States is responsible for his actions; but the person of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,King is declared inviolable by the French Charter. *r,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote q: The Constitution had left it doubtful whether the President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was obliged to consult the Senate in the removal as well as in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appointment of Federal officers. ""The Federalist"" (No. 77) seemed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"establish the affirmative; but in 1789 Congress formally decided that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"and less sanctioned by the laws in France than in America, but in fact","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it exists. In America, it acts by elections and decrees; in France it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proceeds by revolutions; but notwithstanding the different constitutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of these two countries, public opinion is the predominant authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in both of them. The fundamental principle of legislation--a principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"essentially republican--is the same in both countries, although its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences may be different, and its results more or less extensive.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In what I have been saying I have only touched upon the main points,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of distinction; and if I could have entered into details, the contrast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would have been rendered still more striking. I have remarked that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the President in the United States is only exercised within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the limits of a partial sovereignty, whilst that of the King in France","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is undivided. I might have gone on to show that the power of the King's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government in France exceeds its natural limits, however extensive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they may be, and penetrates in a thousand different ways into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration of private interests. Amongst the examples of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence may be quoted that which results from the great number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of public functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government. This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"138,000 *s nominations, each of which may be considered as an element of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power. The President of the United States has not the exclusive right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"making any public appointments, and their whole number scarcely exceeds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"12,000. *t","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote s: The sums annually paid by the State to these officers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"co-operation is no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,carrying on of public affairs. All his important acts are directly or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indirectly submitted to the legislature, and of his own free authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he can do but little. It is therefore his weakness, and not his power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which enables him to remain in opposition to Congress. In Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,harmony must reign between the Crown and the other branches of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"exemplified by experience and by history, and the remarks I am about","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to make refer to America alone. These dangers may be more or less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formidable in proportion to the place which the executive power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occupies, and to the importance it possesses in the State; and they may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vary according to the mode of election and the circumstances in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the election,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a chief magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the pursuit of power, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when legitimate means are wanting force may not unfrequently seize what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right denied.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive authority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are, the greater is the temptation; the more the ambition of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"candidates is excited, the more warmly are their interests espoused by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a throng of partisans who hope to share the power when their patron has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"won the prize. The dangers of the elective system increase, therefore,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the exact ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the affairs of State. The revolutions of Poland were not solely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attributable to the elective system in general, but to the fact that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elected monarch was the sovereign of a powerful kingdom. Before we can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discuss the absolute advantages of the elective system we must make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"preliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people amongst whom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and dependent executive government; for to attempt to render the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representative of the State a powerful sovereign, and at the same time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two incompatible designs. To","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective authority, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only means that I am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accustom the people to live without its protection. Nothing, however, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,further from the designs of the republicans of Europe than this course:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as many of them owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have personally undergone, it is oppression, and not the extent of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"executive power, which excites their hostility, and they attack the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former without perceiving how nearly it is connected with the latter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Hitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his honor and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his life in order to become the President of the United States; because,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the power of that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prize of fortune must be great to encourage adventurers in so desperate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a game. No candidate has as yet been able to arouse the dangerous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enthusiasm or the passionate sympathies of the people in his favor, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the very simple reason that when he is at the head of the Government he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has but little power, but little wealth, and but little glory to share","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amongst his friends; and his influence in the State is too small for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the success or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual to power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as the private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest of a family is always intimately connected with the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the State, the executive government is never suspended for a single","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instant; and if the affairs of a monarchy are not better conducted than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those of a republic, at least there is always some one to conduct them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"well or ill, according to his capacity. In elective States, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, the wheels of government cease to act, as it were, of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own accord at the approach of an election, and even for some time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,previous to that event. The laws may indeed accelerate the operation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the election, which may be conducted with such simplicity and rapidity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the seat of power will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these precautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At the approach of an election the head of the executive government is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wholly occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he can undertake nothing new, and the he will only prosecute with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indifference those designs which another will perhaps terminate. ""I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so near the time of my retirement from office,"" said President Jefferson","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on the 21st of January, 1809 (six weeks before the election), ""that I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment. It appears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to me just to leave to my successor the commencement of those measures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which he will have to prosecute, and for which he will be responsible.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a single point;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. The wider,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the influence of the executive power extends, the greater and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more necessary is its constant action, the more fatal is the term of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suspense; and a nation which is accustomed to the government, or, still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more, one used to the administrative protection of a powerful executive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"which Mr. Buchanan retained office, after the election of Mr. Lincoln,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"States of the South to complete their preparations for the Civil War,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the Executive Government was paralyzed. No greater evil could befall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a nation.--Translator's Note.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,One of the principal vices of the elective system is that it always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introduces a certain degree of instability into the internal and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,external policy of the State. But this disadvantage is less sensibly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,felt if the share of power vested in the elected magistrate is small. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Rome the principles of the Government underwent no variation, although","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Consuls were changed every year, because the Senate, which was an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hereditary assembly, possessed the directing authority. If the elective","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"system were adopted in Europe, the condition of most of the monarchical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States would be changed at every new election. In America the President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercises a certain influence on State affairs, but he does not conduct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them; the preponderating power is vested in the representatives of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whole nation. The political maxims of the country depend therefore on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the mass of the people, not on the President alone; and consequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in America the elective system has no very prejudicial influence on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fixed principles of the Government. But the want of fixed principles is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an evil so inherent in the elective system that it is still extremely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceptible in the narrow sphere to which the authority of the President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extends.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans have admitted that the head of the executive power, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has to bear the whole responsibility of the duties he is called upon to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fulfil, ought to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them at pleasure: the legislative bodies watch the conduct of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,President more than they direct it. The consequence of this arrangement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is, that at every new election the fate of all the Federal public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers is in suspense. Mr. Quincy Adams, on his entry into office,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discharged the majority of the individuals who had been appointed by his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,predecessor: and I am not aware that General Jackson allowed a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,removable functionary employed in the Federal service to retain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his place beyond the first year which succeeded his election. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is sometimes made a subject of complaint that in the constitutional,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,monarchies of Europe the fate of the humbler servants of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Administration depends upon that of the Ministers. But in elective,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Governments this evil is far greater. In a constitutional monarchy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,successive ministries are rapidly formed; but as the principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representative of the executive power does not change, the spirit of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,innovation is kept within bounds; the changes which take place are in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the details rather than in the principles of the administrative system;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but to substitute one system for another, as is done in America","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every four years, by law, is to cause a sort of revolution. As to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misfortunes which may fall upon individuals in consequence of this state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of things, it must be allowed that the uncertain situation of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public officers is less fraught with evil consequences in America than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elsewhere. It is so easy to acquire an independent position in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States that the public officer who loses his place may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deprived of the comforts of life, but not of the means of subsistence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I remarked at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elective system applied to the head of the State are augmented or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decreased by the peculiar circumstances of the people which adopts it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"However the functions of the executive power may be restricted, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must always exercise a great influence upon the foreign policy of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, for a negotiation cannot be opened or successfully carried","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on otherwise than by a single agent. The more precarious and the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perilous the position of a people becomes, the more absolute is the want","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more dangerous does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the elective system of the Chief Magistrate become. The policy of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans in relation to the whole world is exceedingly simple; for it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may almost be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,require the co-operation of any other people. Their independence is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"never threatened. In their present condition, therefore, the functions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the executive power are no less limited by circumstances than by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws; and the President may frequently change his line of policy without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,involving the State in difficulty or destruction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be, the period","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which immediately precedes an election and the moment of its duration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must always be considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proportion to the internal embarrassments and the external dangers of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the country. Few of the nations of Europe could escape the calamities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of anarchy or of conquest every time they might have to elect a new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereign. In America society is so constituted that it can stand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be feared from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pressure of external dangers, and the election of the President is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cause of agitation, but not of ruin.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Besides the dangers which are inherent in the system, many other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"difficulties may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the precaution of the legislator. When a people met in arms on some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public spot to choose its head, it was exposed to all the chances of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civil war resulting from so martial a mode of proceeding, besides","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the dangers of the elective system in itself. The Polish laws, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subjected the election of the sovereign to the veto of a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual, suggested the murder of that individual or prepared the way","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to anarchy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the examination of the institutions and the political as well as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"social condition of the United States, we are struck by the admirable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,harmony of the gifts of fortune and the efforts of man. The nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possessed two of the main causes of internal peace; it was a new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, but it was inhabited by a people grown old in the exercise of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,freedom. America had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislators, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weak and subordinate executive power which could without danger be made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elective.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,various modes of election; and the rules which they laid down upon this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,point admirably correspond to the securities which the physical and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political constitution of the country already afforded. Their object was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to find the mode of election which would best express the choice of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people with the least possible excitement and suspense. It was admitted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the first place that the simple majority should be decisive; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the difficulty was to obtain this majority without an interval of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,delay which it was most important to avoid. It rarely happens that an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual can at once collect the majority of the suffrages of a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people; and this difficulty is enhanced in a republic of confederate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, where local influences are apt to preponderate. The means by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it was proposed to obviate this second obstacle was to delegate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the electoral powers of the nation to a body of representatives. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mode of election rendered a majority more probable; for the fewer the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"electors are, the greater is the chance of their coming to a final","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decision. It also offered an additional probability of a judicious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,choice. It then remained to be decided whether this right of election,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was to be entrusted to a legislative body, the habitual representative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assembly of the nation, or whether an electoral assembly should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formed for the express purpose of proceeding to the nomination of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"President. The Americans chose the latter alternative, from a belief","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the individuals who were returned to make the laws were incompetent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to represent the wishes of the nation in the election of its chief,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrate; and that, as they are chosen for more than a year, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constituency they represent might have changed its opinion in that time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It was thought that if the legislature was empowered to elect the head,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the executive power, its members would, for some time before the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"election, be exposed to the manoeuvres of corruption and the tricks of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intrigue; whereas the special electors would, like a jury, remain mixed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up with the crowd till the day of action, when they would appear for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sole purpose of giving their votes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It was therefore established that every State should name a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of electors, *v who in their turn should elect the President;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and as it had been observed that the assemblies to which the choice of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a chief magistrate had been entrusted in elective countries inevitably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,became the centres of passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an authority which did not belong to them; and that their proceedings,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or the uncertainty which resulted from them, were sometimes prolonged so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much as to endanger the welfare of the State, it was determined that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"electors should all vote upon the same day, without being convoked to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same place. *w This double election rendered a majority probable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,though not certain; for it was possible that as many differences might,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exist between the electors as between their constituents. In this case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it was necessary to have recourse to one of three measures; either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to appoint new electors, or to consult a second time those already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appointed, or to defer the election to another authority. The first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"two of these alternatives, independently of the uncertainty of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"results, were likely to delay the final decision, and to perpetuate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an agitation which must always be accompanied with danger. The third,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that the votes should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be transmitted sealed to the President of the Senate, and that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,should be opened and counted in the presence of the Senate and the House,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Representatives. If none of the candidates has a majority, the House","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Representatives then proceeds immediately to elect a President, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the condition that it must fix upon one of the three candidates who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have the highest numbers. *x,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote v: As many as it sends members to Congress. The number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"electors at the election of 1833 was 288. (See ""The National Calendar,""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote w: The electors of the same State assemble, but they transmit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"it is the majority of the States, and not the majority of the members,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which decides the question; so that New York has not more influence in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the debate than Rhode Island. Thus the citizens of the Union are first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consulted as members of one and the same community; and, if they cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agree, recourse is had to the division of the States, each of which has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a separate and independent vote. This is one of the singularities of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Federal Constitution which can only be explained by the jar of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conflicting interests.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"can never be foreseen, that the election is entrusted to the ordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged to choose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a citizen who has already been designated by a powerful minority of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,special electors. It is by this happy expedient that the respect which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is due to the popular voice is combined with the utmost celerity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Election may be considered as a national crisis--Why?--Passions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,of the election.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the elective system in the United States, and what precautions were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taken by the legislators to obviate its dangers. The Americans are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habitually accustomed to all kinds of elections, and they know by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,experience the utmost degree of excitement which is compatible with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,security. The vast extent of the country and the dissemination of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants render a collision between parties less probable and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous there than elsewhere. The political circumstances under which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the elections have hitherto been carried on have presented no real,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,embarrassments to the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, the epoch of the election of a President of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States may be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence which he exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indirect; but the choice of the President, which is of small importance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to each individual citizen, concerns the citizens collectively; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"however trifling an interest may be, it assumes a great degree of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,importance as soon as it becomes general. The President possesses but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,few means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to the kings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe, but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"numerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in his success. Political parties in the United States are led to rally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"round an individual, in order to acquire a more tangible shape in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eyes of the crowd, and the name of the candidate for the Presidency is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,put forward as the symbol and personification of their theories. For,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these reasons parties are strongly interested in gaining the election,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not so much with a view to the triumph of their principles under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the auspices of the President-elect as to show by the majority which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"returned him, the strength of the supporters of those principles.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,For a long while before the appointed time is at hand the election,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,becomes the most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The ardor of faction is redoubled; and all the artificial passions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the imagination can create in the bosom of a happy and peaceful land,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are agitated and brought to light. The President, on the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is absorbed by the cares of self-defence. He no longer governs for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest of the State, but for that of his re-election; he does homage","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the majority, and instead of checking its passions, as his duty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commands him to do, he frequently courts its worst caprices. As the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"election draws near, the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"populace increase; the citizens are divided into hostile camps, each of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole nation glows,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme of the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"papers, the subject of private conversation, the end of every thought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and every action, the sole interest of the present. As soon as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"choice is determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a calmer season","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"returns, the current of the State, which had nearly broken its banks,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sinks to its usual level: *a but who can refrain from astonishment at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may be asked whether the legislators of the United States did right,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or wrong in allowing the re-election of the President. It seems at first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sight contrary to all reason to prevent the head of the executive power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from being elected a second time. The influence which the talents and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the character of a single individual may exercise upon the fate of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole people, in critical circumstances or arduous times, is well known:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a law preventing the re-election of the chief magistrate would deprive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the citizens of the surest pledge of the prosperity and the security,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the commonwealth; and, by a singular inconsistency, a man would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excluded from the government at the very time when he had shown his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ability in conducting its affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more powerful reasons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be advanced against them. Intrigue and corruption are the natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defects of elective government; but when the head of the State can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"re-elected these evils rise to a great height, and compromise the very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intrigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a narrow sphere;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but when the chief magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the government for his own purposes. In the former case the feeble,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources of an individual are in action; in the latter, the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the work of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"corruption and cabal. The private citizen, who employs the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immoral practices to acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prejudicial to the public prosperity. But if the representative of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"executive descends into the combat, the cares of government dwindle into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"second-rate importance, and the success of his election is his first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,concern. All laws and all the negotiations he undertakes are to him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nothing more than electioneering schemes; places become the reward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of services rendered, not to the nation, but to its chief; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence of the government, if not injurious to the country, is at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,least no longer beneficial to the community for which it was created.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States without perceiving that the desire of being re-elected is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the chief aim of the President; that his whole administration, and even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his most indifferent measures, tend to this object; and that, as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crisis approaches, his personal interest takes the place of his interest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the public good. The principle of re-eligibility renders the corrupt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of elective government still more extensive and pernicious.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the sources of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national existence. Every government seems to be afflicted by some evil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is inherent in its nature, and the genius of the legislator is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shown in eluding its attacks. A State may survive the influence of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"host of bad laws, and the mischief they cause is frequently exaggerated;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but a law which encourages the growth of the canker within must prove,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fatal in the end, although its bad consequences may not be immediately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excessive and unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the crown;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and a measure tending to remove the constitutional provisions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"counterbalance this influence would be radically bad, even if its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,immediate consequences were unattended with evil. By a parity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reasoning, in countries governed by a democracy, where the people is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perpetually drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The greatest proof of the ability of the American legislators is, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they clearly discerned this truth, and that they had the courage to act","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,up to it. They conceived that a certain authority above the body of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people was necessary, which should enjoy a degree of independence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without, however, being entirely beyond the popular control;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an authority which would be forced to comply with the permanent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"determinations of the majority, but which would be able to resist its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"caprices, and to refuse its most dangerous demands. To this end they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centred the whole executive power of the nation in a single arm; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"granted extensive prerogatives to the President, and they armed him with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the veto to resist the encroachments of the legislature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But by introducing the principle of re-election they partly destroyed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their work; and they rendered the President but little inclined to exert,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great power they had vested in his hands. If ineligible a second,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time, the President would be far from independent of the people, for his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsibility would not be lessened; but the favor of the people would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not be so necessary to him as to induce him to court it by humoring its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,desires. If re-eligible (and this is more especially true at the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"day, when political morality is relaxed, and when great men are rare),","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the President of the United States becomes an easy tool in the hands of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the majority. He adopts its likings and its animosities, he hastens to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"anticipate its wishes, he forestalls its complaints, he yields to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"idlest cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature intended","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that he should do, he is ever ready to follow its bidding. Thus, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order not to deprive the State of the talents of an individual, those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,talents have been rendered almost useless; and to reserve an expedient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for extraordinary perils, the country has been exposed to daily dangers.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,and the judicial power now remains to be examined; but in this place,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I cannot conceal my fears from the reader. Their judicial institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercise a great influence on the condition of the Anglo-Americans, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they occupy a prominent place amongst what are probably called political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions: in this respect they are peculiarly deserving of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attention. But I am at a loss to explain the political action of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American tribunals without entering into some technical details of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their constitution and their forms of proceeding; and I know not how to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the reader,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the natural aridity of the subject, or without risking to fall into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obscurity through a desire to be succinct. I can scarcely hope to escape,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these various evils; for if I appear too lengthy to a man of the world,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a lawyer may on the other hand complain of my brevity. But these are the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"natural disadvantages of my subject, and more especially of the point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which I am about to discuss.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The great difficulty was, not to devise the Constitution to the Federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws. Governments","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have in general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they govern, viz., the physical force which is at their own disposal,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the moral force which they derive from the decisions of the courts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of justice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A government which should have no other means of exacting obedience than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"open war must be very near its ruin, for one of two alternatives would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,then probably occur: if its authority was small and its character,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"temperate, it would not resort to violence till the last extremity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and it would connive at a number of partial acts of insubordination,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in which case the State would gradually fall into anarchy; if it was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have recourse to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its physical strength, and would speedily degenerate into a military","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,despotism. So that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,community than its inaction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The great end of justice is to substitute the notion of right for that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of violence, and to place a legal barrier between the power of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government and the use of physical force. The authority which is awarded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the intervention of a court of justice by the general opinion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mankind is so surprisingly great that it clings to the mere formalities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of justice, and gives a bodily influence to the shadow of the law. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,moral force which courts of justice possess renders the introduction of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"physical force exceedingly rare, and is very frequently substituted for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it; but if the latter proves to be indispensable, its power is doubled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the association of the idea of law.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A federal government stands in greater need of the support of judicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions than any other, because it is naturally weak and exposed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to formidable opposition. *c If it were always obliged to resort to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"violence in the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. The Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, required a national judiciary to enforce the obedience of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens to the laws, and to repeal the attacks which might be directed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,against them. The question then remained as to what tribunals were to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise these privileges; were they to be entrusted to the courts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice which were already organized in every State? or was it necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to create federal courts? It may easily be proved that the Union could,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not adapt the judicial power of the States to its wants. The separation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the judiciary from the administrative power of the State no doubt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affects the security of every citizen and the liberty of all. But it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is no less important to the existence of the nation that these several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powers should have the same origin, should follow the same principles,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and act in the same sphere; in a word, that they should be correlative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and homogeneous. No one, I presume, ever suggested the advantage of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"trying offences committed in France by a foreign court of justice, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,order to secure the impartiality of the judges. The Americans form one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people in relation to their Federal Government; but in the bosom of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people divers political bodies have been allowed to subsist which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dependent on the national Government in a few points, and independent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in all the rest; which have all a distinct origin, maxims peculiar to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves, and special means of carrying on their affairs. To entrust","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the execution of the laws of the Union to tribunals instituted by these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political bodies would be to allow foreign judges to preside over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation. Nay, more; not only is each State foreign to the Union at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"large, but it is in perpetual opposition to the common interests, since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whatever authority the Union loses turns to the advantage of the States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thus to enforce the laws of the Union by means of the tribunals of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States would be to allow not only foreign but partial judges to preside,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote c: Federal laws are those which most require courts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"justice, and those at the same time which have most rarely established","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them. The reason is that confederations have usually been formed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independent States, which entertained no real intention of obeying the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"central Government, and which very readily ceded the right of command","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the federal executive, and very prudently reserved the right of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,non-compliance to themselves.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But the number, still more than the mere character, of the tribunals of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the States rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. When the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Constitution was formed there were already thirteen courts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice in the United States which decided causes without appeal. That,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,number is now increased to twenty-four. To suppose that a State can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subsist when its fundamental laws may be subjected to four-and-twenty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different interpretations at the same time is to advance a proposition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alike contrary to reason and to experience.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power to apply the laws of the Union, and to determine certain questions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affecting general interests, which were carefully determined beforehand.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The entire judicial power of the Union was centred in one tribunal,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which was denominated the Supreme Court of the United States. But, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Supreme Court are named neither by the people nor the legislature, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the President of the United States, acting with the advice of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Senate. In order to render them independent of the other authorities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their office was made inalienable; and it was determined that their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"salary, when once fixed, should not be altered by the legislature. *d","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It was easy to proclaim the principle of a Federal judiciary, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulties multiplied when the extent of its jurisdiction was to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,determined.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote d: The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resident Federal judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was termed a ""District Court."" Each of the judges of the Supreme Court","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"annually visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to try the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most important causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrate is styled a ""Circuit Court."" Lastly, all the most serious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cases of litigation are brought before the Supreme Court, which holds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a solemn session once a year, at which all the judges of the Circuit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It will be observed that no analogy exists between the Supreme Court,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the United States and the French Cour de Cassation, since the latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only hears appeals on questions of law. The Supreme Court decides upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"two distinct classes of courts of justice, the utmost care which could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be taken in defining their separate jurisdictions would have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insufficient to prevent frequent collisions between those tribunals. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question then arose to whom the right of deciding the competency of each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,court was to be referred.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In nations which constitute a single body politic, when a question is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"debated between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,third tribunal is generally within reach to decide the difference;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and this is effected without difficulty, because in these nations the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,questions of judicial competency have no connection with the privileges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the national supremacy. But it was impossible to create an arbiter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between a superior court of the Union and the superior court of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,separate State which would not belong to one of these two classes. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was, therefore, necessary to allow one of these courts to judge its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own cause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contested. To grant this privilege to the different courts of the States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would have been to destroy the sovereignty of the Union de facto,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,after having established it de jure; for the interpretation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution would soon have restored that portion of independence to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the States of which the terms of that act deprived them. The object,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the creation of a Federal tribunal was to prevent the courts of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States from deciding questions affecting the national interests in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own department, and so to form a uniform body of jurisprudene for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interpretation of the laws of the Union. This end would not have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accomplished if the courts of the several States had been competent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to decide upon cases in their separate capacities from which they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliged to abstain as Federal tribunals. The Supreme Court of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States was therefore invested with the right of determining all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,questions of jurisdiction. *e,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"thus restricted not only by the laws, but by the interpretation of them;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by one limit which was known, and by another which was dubious; by a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rule which was certain, and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,less serious than they appeared to be. We shall see hereafter that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America the real strength of the country is vested in the provincial far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"certain parties must always be brought before the Federal courts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without any regard to the special nature of the cause; and, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,cases in which a State is a party extended to suits brought against a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State as well as by it, or was exclusively confined to the latter. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question was most elaborately considered in the case of Chisholm v.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Georgia, and was decided by the majority of the Supreme Court in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affirmative. The decision created general alarm among the States, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an amendment was proposed and ratified by which the power was entirely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taken away, so far as it regards suits brought against a State. See","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of competency.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"questions are connected with the interpretation of the law of nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and in this respect they essentially interest the Union in relation to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign powers. Moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,which originate in maritime affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution comprises under one head almost all the cases which by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their very nature come within the limits of the Federal courts. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rule which it lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire system of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ideas, and with a vast multitude of facts. It declares that the judicial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power of the Supreme Court shall extend to all cases in law and equity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arising under the laws of the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Two examples will put the intention of the legislator in the clearest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,light:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution prohibits the States from making laws on the value,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and circulation of money: If, notwithstanding this prohibition, a State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passes a law of this kind, with which the interested parties refuse to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"comply because it is contrary to the Constitution, the case must come","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before a Federal court, because it arises under the laws of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. Again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have been voted by Congress, the Federal court must decide the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"case, because it arises under the interpretation of a law of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental principles of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Federal Constitution. The Union, as it was established in 1789,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possesses, it is true, a limited supremacy; but it was intended that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,within its limits it should form one and the same people. *h Within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those limits the Union is sovereign. When this point is established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and admitted, the inference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States constitute one and the same people within the bounds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prescribed by their Constitution, it is impossible to refuse them the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights which belong to other nations. But it has been allowed, from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"origin of society, that every nation has the right of deciding by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,own courts those questions which concern the execution of its own laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,To this it is answered that the Union is in so singular a position,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that in relation to some matters it constitutes a people, and that in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relation to all the rest it is a nonentity. But the inference to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"drawn is, that in the laws relating to these matters the Union possesses","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the rights of absolute sovereignty. The difficulty is to know what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these matters are; and when once it is resolved (and we have shown,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"how it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jurisdiction of the Federal courts) no further doubt can arise; for as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"soon as it is established that a suit is Federal--that is to say, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it belongs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the Constitution of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union--the natural consequence is that it should come within the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jurisdiction of a Federal court.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote h: This principle was in some measure restricted by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introduction of the several States as independent powers into the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Senate, and by allowing them to vote separately in the House of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Representatives when the President is elected by that body. But these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are exceptions, and the contrary principle is the rule.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or whenever they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are resorted to in self-defence, the Federal courts must be appealed to.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thus the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the Union extends and narrows,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its limits exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,augments or decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislators of 1789 was to divide the sovereign authority into two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,parts. In the one they placed the control of all the general interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Union, in the other the control of the special interests of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its component States. Their chief solicitude was to arm the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government with sufficient power to enable it to resist, within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its sphere, the encroachments of the several States. As for these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"communities, the principle of independence within certain limits of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own was adopted in their behalf; and they were concealed from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inspection, and protected from the control, of the central Government.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In speaking of the division of authority, I observed that this latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principle had not always been held sacred, since the States are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevented from passing certain laws which apparently belong to their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,particular sphere of interest. When a State of the Union passes a law of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this kind, the citizens who are injured by its execution can appeal to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Federal courts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thus the jurisdiction of the Federal courts extends not only to all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cases which arise under the laws of the Union, but also to those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which arise under laws made by the several States in opposition to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution. The States are prohibited from making ex post facto laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in criminal cases, and any person condemned by virtue of a law of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kind can appeal to the judicial power of the Union. The States are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,likewise prohibited from making laws which may have a tendency to impair,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the obligations of contracts. *i If a citizen thinks that an obligation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this kind is impaired by a law passed in his State, he may refuse to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obey it, and may appeal to the Federal courts. *j","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote i: It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (""Commentaries,"" p.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"503, or in the large edition Section 1379), that any law which enlarges,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abridges, or in any manner changes the intention of the parties,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resulting from the stipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He gives in the same place a very long and careful definition of what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,understood by a contract in Federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State to a private individual, and accepted by him, is a contract, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be revoked by any future law. A charter granted by the State to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a company is a contract, and equally binding to the State as to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"grantee. The clause of the Constitution here referred to insures,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, the existence of a great part of acquired rights, but not of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all. Property may legally be held, though it may not have passed into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the possessor's hands by means of a contract; and its possession is an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquired right, not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote j: A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"508, or in the large edition Section 1388): ""Dartmouth College in New","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Hampshire had been founded by a charter granted to certain individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before the American Revolution, and its trustees formed a corporation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"under this charter. The legislature of New Hampshire had, without the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consent of this corporation, passed an act changing the organization of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the original provincial charter of the college, and transferring all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, privileges, and franchises from the old charter trustees to new","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,trustees appointed under the act. The constitutionality of the act was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contested, and, after solemn arguments, it was deliberately held by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Supreme Court that the provincial charter was a contract within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the meaning of the Constitution (Art. I. Section 10), and that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"emendatory act was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that charter. The college was deemed, like other colleges of private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foundation, to be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its charter with a capacity to take property unconnected with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government. Its funds were bestowed upon the faith of the charter, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those funds consisted entirely of private donations. It is true that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"uses were in some sense public, that is, for the general benefit, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the corporation a public corporation. It was a private institution for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,general charity. It was not distinguishable in principle from a private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"donation, vested in private trustees, for a public charity, or for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a particular purpose of beneficence. And the State itself, if it had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bestowed funds upon a charity of the same nature, could not resume those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"funds.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independence of the States. The rights awarded to the Federal Government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for purposes of obvious national importance are definite and easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comprehensible; but those with which this last clause invests it are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not either clearly appreciable or accurately defined. For there are vast,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,numbers of political laws which influence the existence of obligations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Natural weakness of the judiciary power in confederations--Legislators,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ought to strive as much as possible to bring private individuals, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not States, before the Federal Courts--How the Americans have succeeded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in this--Direct prosecution of private individuals in the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Courts--Indirect prosecution of the States which violate the laws of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union--The decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do not destroy the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provincial laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have shown what the privileges of the Federal courts are, and it is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less important to point out the manner in which they are exercised. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,irresistible authority of justice in countries in which the sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in undivided is derived from the fact that the tribunals of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,countries represent the entire nation at issue with the individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"against whom their decree is directed, and the idea of power is thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introduced to corroborate the idea of right. But this is not always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the case in countries in which the sovereignty is divided; in them the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judicial power is more frequently opposed to a fraction of the nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than to an isolated individual, and its moral authority and physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strength are consequently diminished. In federal States the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the judge is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable parties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is augmented. The aim of the legislator in confederate States ought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore to be to render the position of the courts of justice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,analogous to that which they occupy in countries where the sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is undivided; in other words, his efforts ought constantly to tend to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintain the judicial power of the confederation as the representative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual interest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Every government, whatever may be its constitution, requires the means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of constraining its subjects to discharge their obligations, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protecting its privileges from their assaults. As far as the direct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"action of the Government on the community is concerned, the Constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the United States contrived, by a master-stroke of policy, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the federal courts, acting in the name of the laws, should only take","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cognizance of parties in an individual capacity. For, as it had been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,declared that the Union consisted of one and the same people within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the limits laid down by the Constitution, the inference was that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government created by this Constitution, and acting within these limits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was invested with all the privileges of a national government, one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the principal of which is the right of transmitting its injunctions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"directly to the private citizen. When, for instance, the Union votes an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impost, it does not apply to the States for the levying of it, but to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every American citizen in proportion to his assessment. The Supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Court, which is empowered to enforce the execution of this law of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union, exerts its influence not upon a refractory State, but upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private taxpayer; and, like the judicial power of other nations, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposed to the person of an individual. It is to be observed that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is feeble, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,naturally worsted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forward by but against the Union. The Constitution recognizes the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislative power of the States; and a law so enacted may impair the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"privileges of the Union, in which case a collision in unavoidable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between that body and the State which has passed the law: and it only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remains to select the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,deducible from the general principles I have before established. *k,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote k: See Chapter VI. on ""Judicial Power in America.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"might have used the State before a Federal court, which would have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"annulled the act, and by this means it would have adopted a natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,course of proceeding; but the judicial power would have been placed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in open hostility to the State, and it was desirable to avoid this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,predicament as much as possible. The Americans hold that it is nearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible that a new law should not impair the interests of some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,private individual by its provisions: these private interests are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assumed by the American legislators as the ground of attack against such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"measures as may be prejudicial to the Union, and it is to these cases","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the protection of the Supreme Court is extended.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Suppose a State vends a certain portion of its territory to a company,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and that a year afterwards it passes a law by which the territory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is otherwise disposed of, and that clause of the Constitution which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prohibits laws impairing the obligation of contracts violated. When the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purchaser under the second act appears to take possession, the possessor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"under the first act brings his action before the tribunals of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and causes the title of the claimant to be pronounced null and void. *l,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, in point of fact, the judicial power of the Union is contesting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the claims of the sovereignty of a State; but it only acts indirectly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and upon a special application of detail: it attacks the law in its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences, not in its principle, and it rather weakens than destroys","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote l: See Kent's ""Commentaries,"" vol. i. p. 387.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The last hypothesis that remained was that each State formed a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"corporation enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that it could therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. Thus a State,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,could bring an action against another State. In this instance the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was not called upon to contest a provincial law, but to try a suit in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which a State was a party. This suit was perfectly similar to any other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cause, except that the quality of the parties was different; and here","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the danger pointed out at the beginning of this chapter exists with less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chance of being avoided. The inherent disadvantage of the very essence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Federal constitutions is that they engender parties in the bosom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation which present powerful obstacles to the free course of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When we have successively examined in detail the organization of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Supreme Court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,readily admit that a more imposing judicial power was never constituted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by any people. The Supreme Court is placed at the head of all known,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tribunals, both by the nature of its rights and the class of justiciable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,parties which it controls.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In all the civilized countries of Europe the Government has always shown,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the greatest repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,party to be decided by the ordinary course of justice. This repugnance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally attains its utmost height in an absolute Government; and, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the other hand, the privileges of the courts of justice are extended","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the increasing liberties of the people: but no European nation has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at present held that all judicial controversies, without regard to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"origin, can be decided by the judges of common law.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America this theory has been actually put in practice, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Supreme Court of the United States is the sole tribunal of the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Its power extends to all the cases arising under laws and treaties made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the executive and legislative authorities, to all cases of admiralty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and maritime jurisdiction, and in general to all points which affect the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"law of nations. It may even be affirmed that, although its constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is essentially judicial, its prerogatives are almost entirely political.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Its sole object is to enforce the execution of the laws of the Union;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the Union only regulates the relations of the Government with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the citizens, and of the nation with Foreign Powers: the relations of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens amongst themselves are almost exclusively regulated by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereignty of the States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be adduced. In the nations of Europe the courts of justice are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,called upon to try the controversies of private individuals; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Supreme Court of the United States summons sovereign powers to its bar.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the clerk of the court advances on the steps of the tribunal, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"simply says, ""The State of New York versus the State of Ohio,"" it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible not to feel that the Court which he addresses is no ordinary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,body; and when it is recollected that one of these parties represents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one million, and the other two millions of men, one is struck by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsibility of the seven judges whose decision is about to satisfy or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are vested in the hands of the seven judges. Without their active,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,co-operation the Constitution would be a dead letter: the Executive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislative powers; the Legislature demands their protection from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,designs of the Executive; they defend the Union from the disobedience,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the States, the States from the exaggerated claims of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the public interest against the interests of private citizens, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the conservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy. Their power is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of public opinion. They are the all-powerful guardians of a people which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"respects law, but they would be impotent against popular neglect or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,popular contempt. The force of public opinion is the most intractable of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agents, because its exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous to exceed than to remain below the boundary prescribed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men possessed of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but they must be statesmen--politicians, not unread in the signs of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"times, not afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to turn aside such encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union and the obedience which is due to the laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The President, who exercises a limited power, may err without causing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great mischief in the State. Congress may decide amiss without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"destroying the Union, because the electoral body in which Congress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,originates may cause it to retract its decision by changing its members.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But if the Supreme Court is ever composed of imprudent men or bad,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens, the Union may be plunged into anarchy or civil war.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the tribunal, but in the very nature of Federal Governments. We","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have observed that in confederate peoples it is especially necessary to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consolidate the judicial authority, because in no other nations do those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independent persons who are able to cope with the social body exist in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,greater power or in a better condition to resist the physical strength,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Government. But the more a power requires to be strengthened, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more extensive and independent it must be made; and the dangers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which its abuse may create are heightened by its independence and its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"strength. The source of the evil is not, therefore, in the constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the power, but in the constitution of those States which render its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence necessary.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In What Respects The Federal Constitution Is Superior To That Of The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In what respects the Constitution of the Union can be compared to that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the States--Superiority of the Constitution of the Union attributable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the wisdom of the Federal legislators--Legislature of the Union less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependent on the people than that of the States--Executive power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more independent in its sphere--Judicial power less subjected to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inclinations of the majority--Practical consequence of these facts--The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangers inherent in a democratic government eluded by the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislators, and increased by the legislators of the States.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Federal Constitution differs essentially from that of the States in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in the means by which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these ends are promoted a greater analogy exists between them. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"objects of the Governments are different, but their forms are the same;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and in this special point of view there is some advantage in comparing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them together.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am of opinion that the Federal Constitution is superior to all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitutions of the States, for several reasons.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The present Constitution of the Union was formed at a later period,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than those of the majority of the States, and it may have derived some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ameliorations from past experience. But we shall be led to acknowledge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that this is only a secondary cause of its superiority, when we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,recollect that eleven new States *n have been added to the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Confederation since the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that these new republics have always rather exaggerated than avoided the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defects which existed in the former Constitutions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote n: [The number of States has now risen to 46 (1874), besides","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the District of Columbia.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The chief cause of the superiority of the Federal Constitution lay in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the character of the legislators who composed it. At the time when it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was formed the dangers of the Confederation were imminent, and its ruin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seemed inevitable. In this extremity the people chose the men who most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deserved the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the country. I have already observed that distinguished as almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the legislators of the Union were for their intelligence, they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still more so for their patriotism. They had all been nurtured at a time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual struggle against,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a powerful and predominant authority. When the contest was terminated,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst the excited passions of the populace persisted in warring with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dangers which had ceased to threaten them, these men stopped short in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating look upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the country which was now their own; they perceived that the war of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence was definitely ended, and that the only dangers which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America had to fear were those which might result from the abuse of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,freedom she had won. They had the courage to say what they believed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resolutely opposed to destruction. *o,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote o: At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principal founders of the Constitution, ventured to express the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"following sentiments in ""The Federalist,"" No. 71:--","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instituted as of the true means by which the public happiness may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,promoted. The Republican principle demands that the deliberative sense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men who flatter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the people commonly intend the public good. This often applies to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who should pretend that they always reason right about the means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,promoting it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the artifices of men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When occasions present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their inclinations, it is the duty of persons whom they have appointed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sedate reflection. Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their displeasure.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The greater number of the Constitutions of the States assign one year,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for the duration of the House of Representatives, and two years for that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Senate; so that members of the legislative body are constantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and narrowly tied down by the slightest desires of their constituents.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The legislators of the Union were of opinion that this excessive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependence of the Legislature tended to alter the nature of the main,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences of the representative system, since it vested the source,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not only of authority, but of government, in the people. They increased","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the length of the time for which the representatives were returned, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,order to give them freer scope for the exercise of their own judgment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Federal Constitution, as well as the Constitutions of the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, divided the legislative body into two branches. But in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States these two branches were composed of the same elements, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elected in the same manner. The consequence was that the passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and inclinations of the populace were as rapidly and as energetically,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represented in one chamber as in the other, and that laws were made with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the characteristics of violence and precipitation. By the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution the two houses originate in like manner in the choice of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of election,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were changed, to the end that, if, as is the case in certain nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one branch of the Legislature represents the same interests as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other, it may at least represent a superior degree of intelligence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and discretion. A mature age was made one of the conditions of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"senatorial dignity, and the Upper House was chosen by an elected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assembly of a limited number of members.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,To concentrate the whole social force in the hands of the legislative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,body is the natural tendency of democracies; for as this is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power which emanates the most directly from the people, it is made to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"participate most fully in the preponderating authority of the multitude,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and it is naturally led to monopolize every species of influence. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"concentration is at once prejudicial to a well-conducted administration,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and favorable to the despotism of the majority. The legislators of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States frequently yielded to these democratic propensities, which were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,invariably and courageously resisted by the founders of the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the States the executive power is vested in the hands of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrate, who is apparently placed upon a level with the Legislature,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but who is in reality nothing more than the blind agent and the passive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instrument of its decisions. He can derive no influence from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"duration of his functions, which terminate with the revolving year, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the exercise of prerogatives which can scarcely be said to exist.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Legislature can condemn him to inaction by intrusting the execution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the laws to special committees of its own members, and can annul","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his temporary dignity by depriving him of his salary. The Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution vests all the privileges and all the responsibility of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executive power in a single individual. The duration of the Presidency,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is fixed at four years; the salary of the individual who fills that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,office cannot be altered during the term of his functions; he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"protected by a body of official dependents, and armed with a suspensive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"veto. In short, every effort was made to confer a strong and independent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,position upon the executive authority within the limits which had been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prescribed to it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the Constitutions of all the States the judicial power is that which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remains the most independent of the legislative authority; nevertheless,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in all the States the Legislature has reserved to itself the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regulating the emoluments of the judges, a practice which necessarily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subjects these magistrates to its immediate influence. In some States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the judges are only temporarily appointed, which deprives them of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a great portion of their power and their freedom. In others the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislative and judicial powers are entirely confounded; thus the Senate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of New York, for instance, constitutes in certain cases the Superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Court of the State. The Federal Constitution, on the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,carefully separates the judicial authority from all external influences;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and it provides for the independence of the judges, by declaring that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their salary shall not be altered, and that their functions shall be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inalienable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The practical consequences of these different systems may easily be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived. An attentive observer will soon remark that the business of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union is incomparably better conducted than that of any individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State. The conduct of the Federal Government is more fair and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"temperate than that of the States, its designs are more fraught with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wisdom, its projects are more durable and more skilfully combined, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures are put into execution with more vigor and consistency.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I recapitulate the substance of this chapter in a few words: The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence of democracies is threatened by two dangers, viz., the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,complete subjection of the legislative body to the caprices of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the electoral body, and the concentration of all the powers of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government in the legislative authority. The growth of these evils has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been encouraged by the policy of the legislators of the States, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has been resisted by the legislators of the Union by every means which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lay within their control.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Characteristics Which Distinguish The Federal Constitution Of The United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States Of America From All Other Federal Constitutions American Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appears to resemble all other confederations--Nevertheless its effects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are different--Reason of this--Distinctions between the Union and all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other confederations--The American Government not a federal but an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imperfect national Government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The United States of America do not afford either the first or the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instance of confederate States, several of which have existed in modern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe, without adverting to those of antiquity. Switzerland, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Germanic Empire, and the Republic of the United Provinces either have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been or still are confederations. In studying the constitutions of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different countries, the politician is surprised to observe that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powers with which they invested the Federal Government are nearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,identical with the privileges awarded by the American Constitution to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Government of the United States. They confer upon the central power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same rights of making peace and war, of raising money and troops,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of providing for the general exigencies and the common interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation. Nevertheless the Federal Government of these different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peoples has always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as that of the Union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit. Again,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the first American Confederation perished through the excessive weakness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of its Government; and this weak Government was, notwithstanding, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of rights even more extensive than those of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government of the present day. But the more recent Constitution of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States contains certain principles which exercise a most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"important influence, although they do not at once strike the observer.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This Constitution, which may at first sight be confounded with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"federal constitutions which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which may be considered as a great invention in modern political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,science. In all the confederations which had been formed before the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American Constitution of 1789 the allied States agreed to obey the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,injunctions of a Federal Government; but they reserved to themselves the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right of ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws of the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American States which combined in 1789 agreed that the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government should not only dictate the laws, but that it should execute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it own enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the exercise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the right is different; and this alteration produced the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,momentous consequences.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In all the confederations which had been formed before the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union the Federal Government demanded its supplies at the hands of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,separate Governments; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,any one of those bodies means were found to evade its claims: if the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State was powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was weak, it connived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the resistance which the law of the Union, its sovereign, met with,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and resorted to inaction under the plea of inability. Under these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances one of the two alternatives has invariably occurred;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,either the most preponderant of the allied peoples has assumed the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,privileges of the Federal authority and ruled all the States in its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"name, *p or the Federal Government has been abandoned by its natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supporters, anarchy has arisen between the confederates, and the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has lost all powers of action. *q,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote p: This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"execute the decree of the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries, where the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"province of Holland always gave the law; and, in our own time, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Germanic Confederation, in which Austria and Prussia assume a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"degree of influence over the whole country, in the name of the Diet.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote q: Such has always been the situation of the Swiss,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Confederation, which would have perished ages ago but for the mutual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jealousies of its neighbors.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America the subjects of the Union are not States, but private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens: the national Government levies a tax, not upon the State of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Massachusetts, but upon each inhabitant of Massachusetts. All former","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confederate governments presided over communities, but that of the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rules individuals; its force is not borrowed, but self-derived; and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is served by its own civil and military officers, by its own army, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted that the spirit of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation, the passions of the multitude, and the provincial prejudices","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of each State tend singularly to diminish the authority of a Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of resistance to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its mandates; but the comparative weakness of a restricted sovereignty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is an evil inherent in the Federal system. In America, each State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has fewer opportunities of resistance and fewer temptations to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,non-compliance; nor can such a design be put in execution (if indeed it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be entertained) without an open violation of the laws of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a direct interruption of the ordinary course of justice, and a bold","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"declaration of revolt; in a word, without taking a decisive step which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men hesitate to adopt.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In all former confederations the privileges of the Union furnished more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elements of discord than of power, since they multiplied the claims","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accordance with this fact it may be remarked that the real weakness of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,federal governments has almost always been in the exact ratio of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nominal power. Such is not the case in the American Union, in which,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as in ordinary governments, the Federal Government has the means of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enforcing all it is empowered to demand.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The human understanding more easily invents new things than new words,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and we are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inadequate expressions. When several nations form a permanent league,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and establish a supreme authority, which, although it has not the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence over the members of the community as a national government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acts upon each of the Confederate States in a body, this Government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is so essentially different from all others, is denominated a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Federal one. Another form of society is afterwards discovered, in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several peoples are fused into one and the same nation with regard to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"certain common interests, although they remain distinct, or at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only confederate, with regard to all their other concerns. In this case","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the central power acts directly upon those whom it governs, whom it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rules, and whom it judges, in the same manner, as, but in a more limited","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circle than, a national government. Here the term Federal Government is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,clearly no longer applicable to a state of things which must be styled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an incomplete national Government: a form of government has been found,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,out which is neither exactly national nor federal; but no further,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"progress has been made, and the new word which will one day designate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this novel invention does not yet exist.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The absence of this new species of confederation has been the cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which has brought all Unions to Civil War, to subjection, or to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stagnant apathy, and the peoples which formed these leagues have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"either too dull to discern, or too pusillanimous to apply this great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remedy. The American Confederation perished by the same defects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the Confederate States of America had been long accustomed to form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a portion of one empire before they had won their independence; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had not contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prejudices had not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to the rest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the world in political knowledge, and sharing that knowledge equally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amongst themselves, they were little agitated by the passions which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"generally oppose the extension of federal authority in a nation, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those passions were checked by the wisdom of the chief citizens. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans applied the remedy with prudent firmness as soon as they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conscious of the evil; they amended their laws, and they saved their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every part, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ambition of the people is necessarily checked by its weakness, all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,efforts and resources of the citizens are turned to the internal benefit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the community, and are not likely to evaporate in the fleeting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"breath of glory. The desires of every individual are limited, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extraordinary faculties are rarely to be met with. The gifts of an equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fortune render the various conditions of life uniform, and the manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the inhabitants are orderly and simple. Thus, if one estimate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"find that in small nations there are more persons in easy circumstances,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a more numerous population, and a more tranquil state of society, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in great empires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When tyranny is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"galling than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every point of that circle is subject to its direct influence. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,supplies the place of those great designs which it cannot entertain by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a violent or an exasperating interference in a multitude of minute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"details; and it leaves the political world, to which it properly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"belongs, to meddle with the arrangements of domestic life. Tastes as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,well as actions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the citizens as well as the affairs of the State are to be governed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its decisions. This invasion of rights occurs, however, but seldom,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and freedom is in truth the natural state of small communities. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"temptations which the Government offers to ambition are too weak, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the resources of private individuals are too slender, for the sovereign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power easily to fall within the grasp of a single citizen; and should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"such an event have occurred, the subjects of the State can without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by a simultaneous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,effort.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Small nations have therefore ever been the cradle of political liberty;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the fact that many of them have lost their immunities by extending,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their dominion shows that the freedom they enjoyed was more a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequence of the inferior size than of the character of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The history of the world affords no instance of a great nation retaining,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the form of republican government for a long series of years, *r","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and this has led to the conclusion that such a state of things is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impracticable. For my own part, I cannot but censure the imprudence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attempting to limit the possible and to judge the future on the part of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a being who is hourly deceived by the most palpable realities of life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and who is constantly taken by surprise in the circumstances with which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he is most familiar. But it may be advanced with confidence that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of a great republic will always be exposed to far greater,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perils than that of a small one.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote r: I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a great consolidated Republic.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the passions which are most fatal to republican institutions spread,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with an increasing territory, whilst the virtues which maintain their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dignity do not augment in the same proportion. The ambition of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens increases with the power of the State; the strength of parties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the importance of the ends they have in view; but that devotion to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the common weal which is the surest check on destructive passions is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not stronger in a large than in a small republic. It might, indeed, be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proved without difficulty that it is less powerful and less sincere. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arrogance of wealth and the dejection of wretchedness, capital cities of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar egotism, and a great confusion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of interests, are the dangers which almost invariably arise from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magnitude of States. But several of these evils are scarcely prejudicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to a monarchy, and some of them contribute to maintain its existence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In monarchical States the strength of the government is its own; it may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"use, but it does not depend on, the community, and the authority of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prince is proportioned to the prosperity of the nation; but the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,security which a republican government possesses against these evils,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lies in the support of the majority. This support is not, however,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proportionably greater in a large republic than it is in a small one;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and thus, whilst the means of attack perpetually increase both in number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and in influence, the power of resistance remains the same, or it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rather be said to diminish, since the propensities and interests of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people are diversified by the increase of the population, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulty of forming a compact majority is constantly augmented. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has been observed, moreover, that the intensity of human passions is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heightened, not only by the importance of the end which they propose to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attain, but by the multitude of individuals who are animated by them at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same time. Every one has had occasion to remark that his emotions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the midst of a sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would have felt in solitude. In great republics the impetus of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passion is irresistible, not only because it aims at gigantic purposes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but because it is felt and shared by millions of men at the same time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may therefore be asserted as a general proposition that nothing is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more opposed to the well-being and the freedom of man than vast empires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar advantages of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great States. For the very reason which renders the desire of power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more intense in these communities than amongst ordinary men, the love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"glory is also more prominent in the hearts of a class of citizens,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who regard the applause of a great people as a reward worthy of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exertions, and an elevating encouragement to man. If we would learn why","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is that great nations contribute more powerfully to the spread of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human improvement than small States, we shall discover an adequate cause","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the rapid and energetic circulation of ideas, and in those great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cities which are the intellectual centres where all the rays of human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,genius are reflected and combined. To this it may be added that most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,important discoveries demand a display of national power which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government of a small State is unable to make; in great nations the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government entertains a greater number of general notions, and is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,completely disengaged from the routine of precedent and the egotism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of local prejudice; its designs are conceived with more talent, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executed with more boldness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In time of peace the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general and more complete, but they are apt to suffer more acutely from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the calamities of war than those great empires whose distant frontiers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may for ages avert the presence of the danger from the mass of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, which is therefore more frequently afflicted than ruined by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,evil.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessity of the case predominates over all others. If none but small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations existed, I do not doubt that mankind would be more happy and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more free; but the existence of great nations is unavoidable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This consideration introduces the element of physical strength as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition of national prosperity. It profits a people but little to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be affluent and free if it is perpetually exposed to be pillaged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or subjugated; the number of its manufactures and the extent of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commerce are of small advantage if another nation has the empire of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seas and gives the law in all the markets of the globe. Small nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are often impoverished, not because they are small, but because they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weak; the great empires prosper less because they are great than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because they are strong. Physical strength is therefore one of the first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conditions of the happiness and even of the existence of nations. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it occurs that, unless very peculiar circumstances intervene, small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations are always united to large empires in the end, either by force","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or by their own consent: yet I am unacquainted with a more deplorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spectacle than that of a people unable either to defend or to maintain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its independence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Federal system was created with the intention of combining the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different advantages which result from the greater and the lesser,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extent of nations; and a single glance over the United States of America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,suffices to discover the advantages which they have derived from its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adoption.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In great centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,character of uniformity to the laws which does not always suit the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,diversity of customs and of districts; as he takes no cognizance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"special cases, he can only proceed upon general principles; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"population is obliged to conform to the exigencies of the legislation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,since the legislation cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"customs of the population, which is the cause of endless trouble and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misery. This disadvantage does not exist in confederations. Congress,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regulates the principal measures of the national Government, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the details of the administration are reserved to the provincial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislatures. It is impossible to imagine how much this division of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereignty contributes to the well-being of each of the States which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"compose the Union. In these small communities, which are never agitated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the desire of aggrandizement or the cares of self-defence, all public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority and private energy is employed in internal amelioration. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"central government of each State, which is in immediate juxtaposition to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the citizens, is daily apprised of the wants which arise in society; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"new projects are proposed every year, which are discussed either at town","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"meetings or by the legislature of the State, and which are transmitted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the interest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the citizens. This spirit of amelioration is constantly alive in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the American republics, without compromising their tranquillity; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ambition of power yields to the less refined and less dangerous love of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comfort. It is generally believed in America that the existence and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,permanence of the republican form of government in the New World depend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the existence and the permanence of the Federal system; and it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not unusual to attribute a large share of the misfortunes which have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,befallen the new States of South America to the injudicious erection of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great republics, instead of a divided and confederate sovereignty.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government in the United States were engendered in the townships and in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the provincial assemblies. In a small State, like that of Connecticut","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for instance, where cutting a canal or laying down a road is a momentous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political question, where the State has no army to pay and no wars to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"carry on, and where much wealth and much honor cannot be bestowed upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the chief citizens, no form of government can be more natural or more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appropriate than that of a republic. But it is this same republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spirit, it is these manners and customs of a free people, which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"engendered and nurtured in the different States, to be afterwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"applied to the country at large. The public spirit of the Union is, so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to speak, nothing more than an abstract of the patriotic zeal of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provinces. Every citizen of the United States transfuses his attachment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to his little republic in the common store of American patriotism. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defending the Union he defends the increasing prosperity of his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"district, the right of conducting its affairs, and the hope of causing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures of improvement to be adopted which may be favorable to his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest; and these are motives which are wont to stir men more readily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than the general interests of the country and the glory of the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"especially fitted them to promote the welfare of a great republic, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal system smoothed the obstacles which they might have encountered.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The confederation of all the American States presents none of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ordinary disadvantages resulting from great agglomerations of men. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union is a great republic in extent, but the paucity of objects for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which its Government provides assimilates it to a small State. Its acts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are important, but they are rare. As the sovereignty of the Union is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"limited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible with liberty;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for it does not excite those insatiable desires of fame and power which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have proved so fatal to great republics. As there is no common centre to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth, abject poverty, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sudden revolutions are alike unknown; and political passion, instead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of spreading over the land like a torrent of desolation, spends its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strength against the interests and the individual passions of every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate throughout the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as freely as in a country inhabited by one people. Nothing checks the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spirit of enterprise. Government avails itself of the assistance of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who have talents or knowledge to serve it. Within the frontiers of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union the profoundest peace prevails, as within the heart of some great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"empire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of the earth;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two thousand miles of coast are open to the commerce of the world; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as it possesses the keys of the globe, its flags is respected in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most remote seas. The Union is as happy and as free as a small people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"When a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"borne away by the current, after an ineffectual resistance. Like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"navigator, he may direct the vessel which bears him along, but he can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"neither change its structure, nor raise the winds, nor lull the waters","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which swell beneath him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have shown the advantages which the Americans derive from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,federal system; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rendered that system practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by all nations. The incidental defects of the Federal system which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"originate in the laws may be corrected by the skill of the legislator,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but there are further evils inherent in the system which cannot be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,counteracted by the peoples which adopt it. These nations must therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,find the strength necessary to support the natural imperfections of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their Government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The most prominent evil of all Federal systems is the very complex,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature of the means they employ. Two sovereignties are necessarily in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,presence of each other. The legislator may simplify and equalize the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"action of these two sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of authority accurately defined; but he cannot combine them into one, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevent them from coming into collision at certain points. The Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"system therefore rests upon a theory which is necessarily complicated,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and which demands the daily exercise of a considerable share of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discretion on the part of those it governs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people. A false notion which is clear and precise will always meet with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a greater number of adherents in the world than a true principle which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is obscure or involved. Hence it arises that parties, which are like","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"small communities in the heart of the nation, invariably adopt some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principle or some name as a symbol, which very inadequately represents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the end they have in view and the means which are at their disposal, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without which they could neither act nor subsist. The governments which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are founded upon a single principle or a single feeling which is easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"defined are perhaps not the best, but they are unquestionably the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strongest and the most durable in the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In examining the Constitution of the United States, which is the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfect federal constitution that ever existed, one is startled, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the other hand, at the variety of information and the excellence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discretion which it presupposes in the people whom it is meant to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,govern. The government of the Union depends entirely upon legal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fictions; the Union is an ideal nation which only exists in the mind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and whose limits and extent can only be discerned by the understanding.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When once the general theory is comprehended, numberless difficulties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remain to be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union is so involved in that of the States that it is impossible to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinguish its boundaries at the first glance. The whole structure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Government is artificial and conventional; and it would be ill,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adapted to a people which has not been long accustomed to conduct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its own affairs, or to one in which the science of politics has not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descended to the humblest classes of society. I have never been more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,struck by the good sense and the practical judgment of the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulties resulting from their Federal Constitution. I scarcely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ever met with a plain American citizen who could not distinguish, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surprising facility, the obligations created by the laws of Congress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from those created by the laws of his own State; and who, after having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discriminated between the matters which come under the cognizance of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union and those which the local legislature is competent to regulate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,could not point out the exact limit of the several jurisdictions of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal courts and the tribunals of the State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution of the United States is like those exquisite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,productions of human industry which ensure wealth and renown to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inventors, but which are profitless in any other hands. This truth is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exemplified by the condition of Mexico at the present time. The Mexicans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were desirous of establishing a federal system, and they took the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Federal Constitution of their neighbors, the Anglo-Americans, as their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"model, and copied it with considerable accuracy. *s But although they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had borrowed the letter of the law, they were unable to create or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to introduce the spirit and the sense which give it life. They were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,involved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,double government; the sovereignty of the States and that of the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perpetually exceeded their respective privileges, and entered into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,collision; and to the present day Mexico is alternately the victim of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,anarchy and the slave of military despotism.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote s: See the Mexican Constitution of 1824.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The second and the most fatal of all the defects I have alluded to,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and that which I believe to be inherent in the federal system, is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relative weakness of the government of the Union. The principle upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which all confederations rest is that of a divided sovereignty. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislator may render this partition less perceptible, he may even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conceal it for a time from the public eye, but he cannot prevent it from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existing, and a divided sovereignty must always be less powerful than an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,entire supremacy. The reader has seen in the remarks I have made on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Constitution of the United States that the Americans have displayed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,singular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union within the narrow limits of a federal government with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"semblance and, to a certain extent, with the force of a national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government. By this means the legislators of the Union have succeeded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in diminishing, though not in counteracting the natural danger of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confederations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It has been remarked that the American Government does not apply itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the States, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens, and compels them as isolated individuals to comply with its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,demands. But if the Federal law were to clash with the interests and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prejudices of a State, it might be feared that all the citizens of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that State would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,single individual who should refuse to obey. If all the citizens of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the State were aggrieved at the same time and in the same manner by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority of the Union, the Federal Government would vainly attempt to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in a common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"defence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,share of sovereignty which the institution of their State allows them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to enjoy. Fiction would give way to reality, and an organized portion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the territory might then contest the central authority. *t The same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observation holds good with regard to the Federal jurisdiction. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,courts of the Union violated an important law of a State in a private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"case, the real, if not the apparent, contest would arise between the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aggrieved State represented by a citizen and the Union represented by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its courts of justice. *u,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote t: [This is precisely what occurred in 1862, and the following","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,paragraph describes correctly the feelings and notions of the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"General Lee held that his primary allegiance was due, not to the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but to Virginia.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote u: For instance, the Union possesses by the Constitution the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the State of Ohio should claim the same right in behalf of certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"territories lying within its boundaries, upon the plea that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution refers to those lands alone which do not belong to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"jurisdiction of any particular State, and consequently should choose to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dispose of them itself, the litigation would be carried on in the names","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the purchasers from the State of Ohio and the purchasers from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union, and not in the names of Ohio and the Union. But what would become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of this legal fiction if the Federal purchaser was confirmed in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"right by the courts of the Union, whilst the other competitor was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ordered to retain possession by the tribunals of the State of Ohio?],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He would have but a partial knowledge of the world who should imagine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent men from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,finding out and employing those means of gratifying their passions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have been left open to them; and it may be doubted whether the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislators, when they rendered a collision between the two sovereigns","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less probable, destroyed the cause of such a misfortune. But it may even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be affirmed that they were unable to ensure the preponderance of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal element in a case of this kind. The Union is possessed of money,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and of troops, but the affections and the prejudices of the people are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the bosom of the States. The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"being, which is connected with but few external objects; the sovereignty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the States is hourly perceptible, easily understood, constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"active; and if the former is of recent creation, the latter is coeval","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the people itself. The sovereignty of the Union is factitious, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the States is natural, and derives its existence from its own simple","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence, like the authority of a parent. The supreme power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nation only affects a few of the chief interests of society; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represents an immense but remote country, and claims a feeling of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism which is vague and ill defined; but the authority of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States controls every individual citizen at every hour and in all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances; it protects his property, his freedom, and his life; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when we recollect the traditions, the customs, the prejudices of local","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and familiar attachment with which it is connected, we cannot doubt of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the superiority of a power which is interwoven with every circumstance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that renders the love of one's native country instinctive in the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,heart.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Since legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occur between the two sovereignties which coexist in the federal system,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their first object must be, not only to dissuade the confederate States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from warfare, but to encourage such institutions as may promote the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintenance of peace. Hence it results that the Federal compact cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be lasting unless there exists in the communities which are leagued,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,together a certain number of inducements to union which render their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"common dependence agreeable, and the task of the Government light,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and that system cannot succeed without the presence of favorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances added to the influence of good laws. All the peoples which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have ever formed a confederation have been held together by a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of common interests, which served as the intellectual ties of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,association.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consideration as well as his immediate interests. A certain uniformity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of civilization is not less necessary to the durability of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confederation than a uniformity of interests in the States which compose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it. In Switzerland the difference which exists between the Canton of Uri,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the Canton of Vaud is equal to that between the fifteenth and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nineteenth centuries; and, properly speaking, Switzerland has never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possessed a federal government. The union between these two cantons only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsists upon the map, and their discrepancies would soon be perceived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if an attempt were made by a central authority to prescribe the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws to the whole territory.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,One of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Government in America is that the States have not only similar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests, a common origin, and a common tongue, but that they are also","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arrived at the same stage of civilization; which almost always renders,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a union feasible. I do not know of any European nation, how small soever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it may be, which does not present less uniformity in its different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provinces than the American people, which occupies a territory as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extensive as one-half of Europe. The distance from the State of Maine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to that of Georgia is reckoned at about one thousand miles; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difference between the civilization of Maine and that of Georgia is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy and those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Brittany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed at the opposite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extremities of a great empire, are consequently in the natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of more real inducements to form a confederation than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Normandy and Brittany, which are only separated by a bridge.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The geographical position of the country contributed to increase the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,facilities which the American legislators derived from the manners and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,customs of the inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the adoption and the maintenance of the Federal system are mainly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attributable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a people is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the breaking out of a war. In war a people struggles with the energy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a single man against foreign nations in the defence of its very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence. The skill of a government, the good sense of the community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the natural fondness which men entertain for their country, may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suffice to maintain peace in the interior of a district, and to favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its internal prosperity; but a nation can only carry on a great war at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices; and to suppose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that a great number of men will of their own accord comply with these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exigencies of the State is to betray an ignorance of mankind. All the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have consequently been led to augment the power of their government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Those which have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A long war almost always places nations in the wretched alternative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of being abandoned to ruin by defeat or to despotism by success. War,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore renders the symptoms of the weakness of a government most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,palpable and most alarming; and I have shown that the inherent defeat of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,federal governments is that of being weak.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Federal system is not only deficient in every kind of centralized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"administration, but the central government itself is imperfectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"organized, which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the nation is opposed to other countries which are themselves governed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by a single authority. In the Federal Constitution of the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by which the central government possesses more real force, this evil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is still extremely sensible. An example will illustrate the case to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reader.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution confers upon Congress the right of calling forth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,repel invasions; and another article declares that the President of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States is the commander-in-chief of the militia. In the war of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,1812 the President ordered the militia of the Northern States to march,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the frontiers; but Connecticut and Massachusetts, whose interests","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were impaired by the war, refused to obey the command. They argued that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to call forth the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"militia in case of insurrection or invasion, but that in the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instance there was neither invasion nor insurrection. They added,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the same Constitution which conferred upon the Union the right,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of calling forth the militia reserved to the States that of naming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the officers; and that consequently (as they understood the clause) no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officer of the Union had any right to command the militia, even during","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"war, except the President in person; and in this case they were ordered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to join an army commanded by another individual. These absurd and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pernicious doctrines received the sanction not only of the governors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the legislative bodies, but also of the courts of justice in both","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States; and the Federal Government was constrained to raise elsewhere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the troops which it required. *v,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote v: Kent's ""Commentaries,"" vol. i. p. 244. I have selected an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,example which relates to a time posterior to the promulgation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the present Constitution. If I had gone back to the days of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Confederation, I might have given still more striking instances. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whole nation was at that time in a state of enthusiastic excitement; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Revolution was represented by a man who was the idol of the people; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at that very period Congress had, to say the truth, no resources at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all at its disposal. Troops and supplies were perpetually wanting. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"best-devised projects failed in the execution, and the Union, which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constantly on the verge of destruction, was saved by the weakness of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enemies far more than by its own strength. [All doubt as to the powers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Federal Executive was, however, removed by its efforts in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Civil War, and those powers were largely extended.]]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The only safeguard which the American Union, with all the relative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfection of its laws, possesses against the dissolution which would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be produced by a great war, lies in its probable exemption from that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"calamity. Placed in the centre of an immense continent, which offers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a boundless field for human industry, the Union is almost as much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insulated from the world as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Canada contains only a million of inhabitants, and its population is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,divided into two inimical nations. The rigor of the climate limits the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extension of its territory, and shuts up its ports during the six months","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of winter. From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico a few savage tribes are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before six","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thousand soldiers. To the South, the Union has a point of contact with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities may one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day be expected to arise. But for a long while to come the uncivilized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"state of the Mexican community, the depravity of its morals, and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extreme poverty, will prevent that country from ranking high amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations. *w As for the Powers of Europe, they are too distant to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,envy the lot of those nations which have been enabled to adopt it; but I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot believe that any confederate peoples could maintain a long or an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,equal contest with a nation of similar strength in which the government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,should be centralized. A people which should divide its sovereignty into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fractional powers, in the presence of the great military monarchies of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe, would, in my opinion, by that very act, abdicate its power, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States; I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passed their legislation in review, and I have depicted the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,characteristics of political society in that country. But a sovereign,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power exists above these institutions and beyond these characteristic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,features which may destroy or modify them at its pleasure--I mean that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the people. It remains to be shown in what manner this power, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regulates the laws, acts: its propensities and its passions remain to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard, accelerate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or direct its irresistible course; and the effects of its unbounded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, with the destiny which is probably reserved for it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America the people appoints the legislative and the executive power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in all their consequences; and the people elects its representatives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"directly, and for the most part annually, in order to ensure their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependence. The people is therefore the real directing power; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"although the form of government is representative, it is evident that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the passions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the community are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a perpetual influence on society. In the United States the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governs in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in which the people is supreme. The majority is principally composed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of peaceful citizens who, either by inclination or by interest, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sincerely desirous of the welfare of their country. But they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surrounded by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Parties In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A great distinction must be made between parties. Some countries are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so large that the different populations which inhabit them have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contradictory interests, although they are the subjects of the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government, and they may thence be in a perpetual state of opposition.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In this case the different fractions of the people may more properly be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,considered as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"breaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival peoples rather than by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,factions in the State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But when the citizens entertain different opinions upon subjects which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affect the whole country alike, such, for instance, as the principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon which the government is to be conducted, then distinctions arise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which may correctly be styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,free governments; but they have not at all times the same character and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same propensities.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable evils,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as to conceive the design of effecting a total change in its political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution; at other times the mischief lies still deeper, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of society itself is endangered. Such are the times of great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,revolutions and of great parties. But between these epochs of misery and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of confusion there are periods during which human society seems to rest,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and mankind to make a pause. This pause is, indeed, only apparent, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time does not stop its course for nations any more than for men; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are all advancing towards a goal with which they are unacquainted; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we only imagine them to be stationary when their progress escapes our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observation, as men who are going at a foot-pace seem to be standing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still to those who run.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But however this may be, there are certain epochs at which the changes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that take place in the social and political constitution of nations are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so slow and so insensible that men imagine their present condition to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a final state; and the human mind, believing itself to be firmly based","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon certain foundations, does not extend its researches beyond the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,horizon which it descries. These are the times of small parties and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intrigue.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The political parties which I style great are those which cling to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles more than to their consequences; to general, and not to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"especial cases; to ideas, and not to men. These parties are usually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinguished by a nobler character, by more generous passions, more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"genuine convictions, and a more bold and open conduct than the others.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In them private interest, which always plays the chief part in political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passions, is more studiously veiled under the pretext of the public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,good; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the eyes of the very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,persons whom it excites and impels.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Minor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faith. As they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty purpose, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ostensibly display the egotism of their character in their actions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They glow with a factitious zeal; their language is vehement, but their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conduct is timid and irresolute. The means they employ are as wretched,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as the end at which they aim. Hence it arises that when a calm state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of things succeeds a violent revolution, the leaders of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seem suddenly to disappear, and the powers of the human mind to lie","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"concealed. Society is convulsed by great parties, by minor ones it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disturb it to no good end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America has already lost the great parties which once divided the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation; and if her happiness is considerably increased, her morality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has suffered by their extinction. When the War of Independence was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"terminated, and the foundations of the new Government were to be laid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"down, the nation was divided between two opinions--two opinions which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are as old as the world, and which are perpetually to be met with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,under all the forms and all the names which have ever obtained in free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"communities--the one tending to limit, the other to extend indefinitely,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the power of the people. The conflict of these two opinions never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assumed that degree of violence in America which it has frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"displayed elsewhere. Both parties of the Americans were, in fact, agreed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the most essential points; and neither of them had to destroy a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"traditionary constitution, or to overthrow the structure of society, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order to ensure its own triumph. In neither of them, consequently, were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a great number of private interests affected by success or by defeat;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but moral principles of a high order, such as the love of equality and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of independence, were concerned in the struggle, and they sufficed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kindle violent passions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The party which desired to limit the power of the people endeavored to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"apply its doctrines more especially to the Constitution of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whence it derived its name of Federal. The other party, which affected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be more exclusively attached to the cause of liberty, took that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Republican. America is a land of democracy, and the Federalists were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,always in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great men who had been called forth by the War of Independence, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their moral influence was very considerable. Their cause was, moreover,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,favored by circumstances. The ruin of the Confederation had impressed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people with a dread of anarchy, and the Federalists did not fail to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,profit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten or twelve,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"years they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to apply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some, though not all, of their principles; for the hostile current was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,becoming from day to day too violent to be checked or stemmed. In 1801,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Republicans got possession of the Government; Thomas Jefferson was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,named President; and he increased the influence of their party by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weight of his celebrity, the greatness of his talents, and the immense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extent of his popularity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The means by which the Federalists had maintained their position were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"artificial, and their resources were temporary; it was by the virtues","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or the talents of their leaders that they had risen to power. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Republicans attained to that lofty station, their opponents were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,overwhelmed by utter defeat. An immense majority declared itself against,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the retiring party, and the Federalists found themselves in so small a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,minority that they at once despaired of their future success. From that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,moment the Republican or Democratic party *a has proceeded from conquest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to conquest, until it has acquired absolute supremacy in the country.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Federalists, perceiving that they were vanquished without resource,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two divisions, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which one joined the victorious Republicans, and the other abandoned its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rallying-point and its name. Many years have already elapsed since they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ceased to exist as a party.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: [It is scarcely necessary to remark that in more recent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,times the signification of these terms has changed. The Republicans are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the representatives of the old Federalists, and the Democrats of the old","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Republicans.--Trans. Note (1861).]] The accession of the Federalists,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to power was, in my opinion, one of the most fortunate incidents which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accompanied the formation of the great American Union; they resisted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the inevitable propensities of their age and of the country. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whether their theories were good or bad, they had the effect of being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inapplicable, as a system, to the society which they professed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"govern, and that which occurred under the auspices of Jefferson must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore have taken place sooner or later. But their Government gave,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the new republic time to acquire a certain stability, and afterwards to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,support the rapid growth of the very doctrines which they had combated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A considerable number of their principles were in point of fact embodied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the political creed of their opponents; and the Federal Constitution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which subsists at the present day is a lasting monument of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism and their wisdom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Great political parties are not, then, to be met with in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States at the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found which threaten","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the future tranquillity of the Union; but there are none which seem to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contest the present form of Government or the present course of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The parties by which the Union is menaced do not rest upon abstract,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles, but upon temporal interests. These interests, disseminated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the provinces of so vast an empire, may be said to constitute rival","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations rather than parties. Thus, upon a recent occasion, the North","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contended for the system of commercial prohibition, and the South","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"took up arms in favor of free trade, simply because the North is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manufacturing and the South an agricultural district; and that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,restrictive system which was profitable to the one was prejudicial to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the other. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote b: [The divisions of North and South have since acquired a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"far greater degree of intensity, and the South, though conquered,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still presents a formidable spirit of opposition to Northern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government.--Translator's Note, 1875.]]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the absence of great parties, the United States abound with lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,controversies; and public opinion is divided into a thousand minute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shades of difference upon questions of very little moment. The pains,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which are taken to create parties are inconceivable, and at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day it is no easy task. In the United States there is no religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"animosity, because all religion is respected, and no sect is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"predominant; there is no jealousy of rank, because the people is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"everything, and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,position of the country opens so wide a field to industry that man is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able to accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources. Nevertheless, ambitious men are interested in the creation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"parties, since it is difficult to eject a person from authority upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mere ground that his place is coveted by others. The skill of the actors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the political world lies therefore in the art of creating parties. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political aspirant in the United States begins by discriminating his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest, and by calculating upon those interests which may be collected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,around and amalgamated with it; he then contrives to discover some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,doctrine or some principle which may suit the purposes of this new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"association, and which he adopts in order to bring forward his party and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to secure his popularity; just as the imprimatur of a King was in former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"days incorporated with the volume which it authorized, but to which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nowise belonged. When these preliminaries are terminated, the new party","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is ushered into the political world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stranger to be so incomprehensible and so puerile that he is at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,loss whether to pity a people which takes such arrant trifles in good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"earnest, or to envy the happiness which enables it to discuss them. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when he comes to study the secret propensities which govern the factions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of America, he easily perceives that the greater part of them are more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or less connected with one or the other of those two divisions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have always existed in free communities. The deeper we penetrate into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the working of these parties, the more do we perceive that the object","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the popular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority. I do not assert that the ostensible end, or even that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"secret aim, of American parties is to promote the rule of aristocracy or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democracy in the country; but I affirm that aristocratic or democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passions may easily be detected at the bottom of all parties, and that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"although they escape a superficial observation, they are the main point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the very soul of every faction in the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"To quote a recent example. When the President attacked the Bank, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rallied round the Bank, the common people round the President. But it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must not be imagined that the people had formed a rational opinion upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a question which offers so many difficulties to the most experienced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,statesmen. The Bank is a great establishment which enjoys an independent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence, and the people, accustomed to make and unmake whatsoever it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleases, is startled to meet with this obstacle to its authority. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,midst of the perpetual fluctuation of society the community is irritated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by so permanent an institution, and is led to attack it in order to see","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the other institutions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Secret opposition of wealthy individuals to democracy--Their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,retirement--Their taste for exclusive pleasures and for luxury at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,home--Their simplicity abroad--Their affected condescension towards the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It sometimes happens in a people amongst which various opinions prevail,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them obtains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles, harasses its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opponents, and appropriates all the resources of society to its own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,purposes. The vanquished citizens despair of success and they conceal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their dissatisfaction in silence and in general apathy. The nation seems,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be governed by a single principle, and the prevailing party assumes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the credit of having restored peace and unanimity to the country. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to alarming dissensions and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perpetual opposition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This is precisely what occurred in America; when the democratic party,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"got the upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs, and from that time the laws and the customs of society have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been adapted to its caprices. At the present day the more affluent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,classes of society are so entirely removed from the direction of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political affairs in the United States that wealth, far from conferring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a right to the exercise of power, is rather an obstacle than a means of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attaining to it. The wealthy members of the community abandon the lists,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"through unwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend in vain,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,against the poorest classes of their fellow citizens. They concentrate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all their enjoyments in the privacy of their homes, where they occupy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a rank which cannot be assumed in public; and they constitute a private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society in the State, which has its own tastes and its own pleasures.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They submit to this state of things as an irremediable evil, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are careful not to show that they are galled by its continuance; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is even not uncommon to hear them laud the delights of a republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, and the advantages of democratic institutions when they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are in public. Next to hating their enemies, men are most inclined to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,flatter them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Mark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a Jew of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Middle Ages to conceal his wealth. His dress is plain, his demeanor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unassuming; but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,none but a few chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,allowed to penetrate into this sanctuary. No European noble is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exclusive in his pleasures, or more jealous of the smallest advantages","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which his privileged station confers upon him. But the very same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual crosses the city to reach a dark counting-house in the centre,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of traffic, where every one may accost him who pleases. If he meets his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two citizens discuss","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the affairs of the State in which they have an equal interest, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shake hands before they part.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the preponderating power, it is easy to perceive that the wealthy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,members of the community entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions of their country. The populace is at once the object,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their scorn and of their fears. If the maladministration of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy ever brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions ever become practicable in the United States, the truth of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,what I advance will become obvious.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,modifies customs as well as laws. In another part of this work I shall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attempt to determinate the degree of influence which the liberty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the press has exercised upon civil society in the United States, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"point out the direction which it has given to the ideas, as well as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tone which it has imparted to the character and the feelings, of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans, but at present I purpose simply to examine the effects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,produced by the liberty of the press in the political world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I confess that I do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the liberty of the press which things that are supremely good in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very nature are wont to excite in the mind; and I approve of it more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from a recollection of the evils it prevents than from a consideration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the advantages it ensures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If any one could point out an intermediate and yet a tenable position,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the complete independence and the entire subjection of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public expression of opinion, I should perhaps be inclined to adopt it;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but the difficulty is to discover this position. If it is your intention,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to correct the abuses of unlicensed printing and to restore the use of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"orderly language, you may in the first instance try the offender by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a jury; but if the jury acquits him, the opinion which was that of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,single individual becomes the opinion of the country at large. Too much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and too little has therefore hitherto been done. If you proceed, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must bring the delinquent before a court of permanent judges. But even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,here the cause must be heard before it can be decided; and the very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principles which no book would have ventured to avow are blazoned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forth in the pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a single","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,composition is then repeated in a multitude of other publications.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The language in which a thought is embodied is the mere carcass of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thought, and not the idea itself; tribunals may condemn the form, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the sense and spirit of the work is too subtle for their authority. Too,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much has still been done to recede, too little to attain your end; you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must therefore proceed. If you establish a censorship of the press, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tongue of the public speaker will still make itself heard, and you have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only increased the mischief. The powers of thought do not rely, like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powers of physical strength, upon the number of their mechanical agents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nor can a host of authors be reckoned like the troops which compose an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"army; on the contrary, the authority of a principle is often increased","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the smallness of the number of men by whom it is expressed. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"words of a strong-minded man, which penetrate amidst the passions of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"listening assembly, have more power than the vociferations of a thousand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"orators; and if it be allowed to speak freely in any public place,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the consequence is the same as if free speaking was allowed in every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,village. The liberty of discourse must therefore be destroyed as well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as the liberty of the press; this is the necessary term of your efforts;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but if your object was to repress the abuses of liberty, they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,brought you to the feet of a despot. You have been led from the extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of independence to the extreme of subjection without meeting with a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,single tenable position for shelter or repose.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There are certain nations which have peculiar reasons for cherishing the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty of the press, independently of the general motives which I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,just pointed out. For in certain countries which profess to enjoy the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,privileges of freedom every individual agent of the Government may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"violate the laws with impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosecute him before the courts of justice. In this case the liberty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the press is not merely a guarantee, but it is the only guarantee, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their liberty and their security which the citizens possess. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rulers of these nations propose to abolish the independence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"press, the people would be justified in saying: Give us the right of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prosecuting your offences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may then waive our right of appeal to the tribunal of public opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But in the countries in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dangerous, but it is absurd. When the right of every citizen to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"co-operate in the government of society is acknowledged, every citizen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must be presumed to possess the power of discriminating between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different opinions of his contemporaries, and of appreciating the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different facts from which inferences may be drawn. The sovereignty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people and the liberty of the press may therefore be looked upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as correlative institutions; just as the censorship of the press and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"universal suffrage are two things which are irreconcilably opposed, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which cannot long be retained among the institutions of the same people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Not a single individual of the twelve millions who inhabit the territory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the United States has as yet dared to propose any restrictions to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the liberty of the press. The first newspaper over which I cast my eyes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon my arrival in America, contained the following article:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In all this affair the language of Jackson has been that of a heartless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despot, solely occupied with the preservation of his own authority.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Ambition is his crime, and it will be his punishment too: intrigue is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks, and will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deprive him of his power: he governs by means of corruption, and his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,immoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. His conduct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the political arena has been that of a shameless and lawless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"approaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which his heart is likely to remain forever unacquainted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not uncommonly imagined in France that the virulence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"press originates in the uncertain social condition, in the political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excitement, and the general sense of consequent evil which prevail in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that country; and it is therefore supposed that as soon as society has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resumed a certain degree of composure the press will abandon its present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vehemence. I am inclined to think that the above causes explain the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reason of the extraordinary ascendency it has acquired over the nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but that they do not exercise much influence upon the tone of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,language. The periodical press appears to me to be actuated by passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and propensities independent of the circumstances in which it is placed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the present position of America corroborates this opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America is perhaps, at this moment, the country of the whole world","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which contains the fewest germs of revolution; but the press is not less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"destructive in its principles than in France, and it displays the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"violence without the same reasons for indignation. In America, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in France, it constitutes a singular power, so strangely composed of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mingled good and evil that it is at the same time indispensable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence of freedom, and nearly incompatible with the maintenance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public order. Its power is certainly much greater in France than in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States; though nothing is more rare in the latter country than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hear of a prosecution having been instituted against it. The reason,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this is perfectly simple: the Americans, having once admitted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, apply it with perfect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consistency. It was never their intention to found a permanent state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of things with elements which undergo daily modifications; and there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is consequently nothing criminal in an attack upon the existing laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provided it be not attended with a violent infraction of them. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are moreover of opinion that courts of justice are unable to check,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the abuses of the press; and that as the subtilty of human language,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hold that to act with efficacy upon the press it would be necessary to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"find a tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of things, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,capable of surmounting the influence of public opinion; a tribunal which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"should conduct its proceedings without publicity, which should pronounce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its decrees without assigning its motives, and punish the intentions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even more than the language of an author. Whosoever should have the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power of creating and maintaining a tribunal of this kind would waste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his time in prosecuting the liberty of the press; for he would be the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supreme master of the whole community, and he would be as free to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rid himself of the authors as of their writings. In this question,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme license; in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,order to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the liberty of the press,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,engenders. To expect to acquire the former and to escape the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is to cherish one of those illusions which commonly mislead nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in their times of sickness, when, tired with faction and exhausted by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effort, they attempt to combine hostile opinions and contrary principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the same soil.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The small influence of the American journals is attributable to several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reasons, amongst which are the following:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The liberty of writing, like all other liberty, is most formidable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when it is a novelty; for a people which has never been accustomed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,co-operate in the conduct of State affairs places implicit confidence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the first tribune who arouses its attention. The Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have enjoyed this liberty ever since the foundation of the settlements;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moreover, the press cannot create human passions by its own power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,however skillfully it may kindle them where they exist. In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"politics are discussed with animation and a varied activity, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rarely touch those deep passions which are excited whenever the positive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest of a part of the community is impaired: but in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States the interests of the community are in a most prosperous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition. A single glance upon a French and an American newspaper is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sufficient to show the difference which exists between the two nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on this head. In France the space allotted to commercial advertisements,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is very limited, and the intelligence is not considerable, but the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,essential part of the journal is that which contains the discussion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the politics of the day. In America three-quarters of the enormous sheet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is set before the reader are filled with advertisements, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remainder is frequently occupied by political intelligence or trivial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,anecdotes: it is only from time to time that one finds a corner devoted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to passionate discussions like those with which the journalists of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,France are wont to indulge their readers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sagacity of the pettiest as well as the greatest of despots, that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of a power is increased in proportion as its direction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is rendered more central. In France the press combines a twofold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"centralization; almost all its power is centred in the same spot, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vested in the same hands, for its organs are far from numerous. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence of a public press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must be unbounded. It is an enemy with which a Government may sign an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Neither of these kinds of centralization exists in America. The United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States have no metropolis; the intelligence as well as the power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country are dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they cross each other in every direction; the Americans have established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no central control over the expression of opinion, any more than over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the conduct of business. These are circumstances which do not depend on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,human foresight; but it is owing to the laws of the Union that there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are no licenses to be granted to printers, no securities demanded from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"editors as in France, and no stamp duty as in France and formerly in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,England. The consequence of this is that nothing is easier than to set,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up a newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expenses of the editor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The number of periodical and occasional publications which appears,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the United States actually surpasses belief. The most enlightened,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans attribute the subordinate influence of the press to this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excessive dissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,science in that country that the only way to neutralize the effect of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public journals is to multiply them indefinitely. I cannot conceive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that a truth which is so self-evident should not already have been more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally admitted in Europe; it is comprehensible that the persons who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hope to bring about revolutions by means of the press should be desirous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of confining its action to a few powerful organs, but it is perfectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incredible that the partisans of the existing state of things, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"natural supporters of the law, should attempt to diminish the influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the press by concentrating its authority. The Governments of Europe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seem to treat the press with the courtesy of the knights of old; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are anxious to furnish it with the same central power which they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"found to be so trusty a weapon, in order to enhance the glory of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resistance to its attacks.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"design can be communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently led to fight under his own standard. All the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,journals of the United States are indeed arrayed on the side of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration or against it; but they attack and defend in a thousand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different ways. They cannot succeed in forming those great currents of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. This division of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of the press produces a variety of other consequences which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are scarcely less remarkable. The facility with which journals can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,established induces a multitude of individuals to take a part in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them; but as the extent of competition precludes the possibility of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"considerable profit, the most distinguished classes of society are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rarely led to engage in these undertakings. But such is the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the public prints that, even if they were a source of wealth, writers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of ability could not be found to direct them all. The journalists of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States are usually placed in a very humble position, with a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scanty education and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the majority is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits which form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the characteristics of each peculiar class of society; thus it dictates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"characteristics of the French journalist consist in a violent, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently an eloquent and lofty, manner of discussing the politics","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the day; and the exceptions to this habitual practice are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,occasional. The characteristics of the American journalist consist in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an open and coarse appeal to the passions of the populace; and he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,habitually abandons the principles of political science to assail the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"characters of individuals, to track them into private life, and disclose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all their weaknesses and errors.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the powers of thought;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I shall have occasion to point out hereafter the influence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"newspapers upon the taste and the morality of the American people, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,my present subject exclusively concerns the political world. It cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be denied that the effects of this extreme license of the press tend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,indirectly to the maintenance of public order. The individuals who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are already in the possession of a high station in the esteem of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-citizens are afraid to write in the newspapers, and they are thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,deprived of the most powerful instrument which they can use to excite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the passions of the multitude to their own advantage. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: They only write in the papers when they choose to address,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people in their own name; as, for instance, when they are called","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon to repel calumnious imputations, and to correct a misstatement of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,facts.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eyes of the public: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"knowledge of certain facts, and it is only by altering or distorting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those facts that a journalist can contribute to the support of his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,views.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But although the press is limited to these resources, its influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in America is immense. It is the power which impels the circulation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political life through all the districts of that vast territory. Its eye,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is constantly open to detect the secret springs of political designs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and to summon the leaders of all parties to the bar of public opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It rallies the interests of the community round certain principles, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it draws up the creed which factions adopt; for it affords a means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intercourse between parties which hear, and which address each other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without ever having been in immediate contact. When a great number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the organs of the press adopt the same line of conduct, their influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"becomes irresistible; and public opinion, when it is perpetually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States each separate journal exercises but little authority, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the power of the periodical press is only second to that of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote b: See Appendix, P.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The opinions established in the United States under the empire of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberty of the press are frequently more firmly rooted than those which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are formed elsewhere under the sanction of a censor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the conduct of public affairs; and the measures of the administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules of consistency or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of order. But the general principles of the Government are more stable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the opinions most prevalent in society are generally more durable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than in many other countries. When once the Americans have taken up an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"idea, whether it be well or ill founded, nothing is more difficult than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to eradicate it from their minds. The same tenacity of opinion has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observed in England, where, for the last century, greater freedom of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conscience and more invincible prejudices have existed than in all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other countries of Europe. I attribute this consequence to a cause which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may at first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency, namely, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the liberty of the press. The nations amongst which this liberty exists,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are as apt to cling to their opinions from pride as from conviction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They cherish them because they hold them to be just, and because they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercised their own free-will in choosing them; and they maintain them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not only because they are true, but because they are their own. Several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other reasons conduce to the same end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It was remarked by a man of genius that ""ignorance lies at the two ends","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of knowledge."" Perhaps it would have been more correct to have said,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that absolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that doubt lies in the middle; for the human intellect may be considered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in three distinct states, which frequently succeed one another. A man","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"believes implicitly, because he adopts a proposition without inquiry. He","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,doubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections which his inquiries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may have aroused. But he frequently succeeds in satisfying these doubts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and then he begins to believe afresh: he no longer lays hold on a truth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in its most shadowy and uncertain form, but he sees it clearly before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him, and he advances onwards by the light it gives him. *c","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote c: It may, however, be doubted whether this rational","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and self-guiding conviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,devotedness in men as their first dogmatical belief.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in the first of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these three states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"believing implicitly without investigation, but it constantly modifies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the objects of their intuitive convictions. The human mind continues,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to discern but one point upon the whole intellectual horizon, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that point is in continual motion. Such are the symptoms of sudden,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"revolutions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to befall those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generations which abruptly adopt the unconditional freedom of the press.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the touch","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of experience is upon them, and the doubt and mistrust which their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uncertainty produces become universal. We may rest assured that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority of mankind will either believe they know not wherefore, or will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not know what to believe. Few are the beings who can ever hope to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attain to that state of rational and independent conviction which true,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,knowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of doubt.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sometimes change their religious opinions; whereas in times of general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scepticism everyone clings to his own persuasion. The same thing takes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,place in politics under the liberty of the press. In countries where all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the theories of social science have been contested in their turn, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens who have adopted one of them stick to it, not so much because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are assured of its excellence, as because they are not convinced of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the superiority of any other. In the present age men are not very ready,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to die in defence of their opinions, but they are rarely inclined to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,change them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer apostates.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Another still more valid reason may yet be adduced: when no abstract,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions are looked upon as certain, men cling to the mere propensities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and external interests of their position, which are naturally more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tangible and more permanent than any opinions in the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not a question of easy solution whether aristocracy or democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is most fit to govern a country. But it is certain that democracy annoys,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one part of the community, and that aristocracy oppresses another part.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When the question is reduced to the simple expression of the struggle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"between poverty and wealth, the tendency of each side of the dispute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Political Associations In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In no country in the world has the principle of association been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different objects, than in America. Besides the permanent associations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which are established by law under the names of townships, cities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agency of private individuals.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest infancy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to rely upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulties of life; he looks upon social authority with an eye of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mistrust and anxiety, and he only claims its assistance when he is quite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unable to shift without it. This habit may even be traced in the schools,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the rising generation, where the children in their games are wont to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"submit to rules which they have themselves established, and to punish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The same spirit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pervades every act of social life. If a stoppage occurs in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is hindered, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,neighbors immediately constitute a deliberative body; and this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extemporaneous assembly gives rise to an executive power which remedies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the inconvenience before anybody has thought of recurring to an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority superior to that of the persons immediately concerned. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public pleasures are concerned, an association is formed to provide","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. Societies are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed to resist enemies which are exclusively of a moral nature, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,diminish the vice of intemperance: in the United States associations are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"established to promote public order, commerce, industry, morality, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religion; for there is no end which the human will, seconded by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of association upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the course of society, and I must confine myself for the present to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political world. When once the right of association is recognized, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens may employ it in several different ways.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,An association consists simply in the public assent which a number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals give to certain doctrines, and in the engagement which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The right of association with these views is very analogous to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberty of unlicensed writing; but societies thus formed possess more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority than the press. When an opinion is represented by a society,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. It numbers its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"partisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause: they, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other hand, become acquainted with each other, and their zeal is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,increased by their number. An association unites the efforts of minds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have a tendency to diverge in one single channel, and urges them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vigorously towards one single end which it points out.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The second degree in the right of association is the power of meeting.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When an association is allowed to establish centres of action at certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"important points in the country, its activity is increased and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence extended. Men have the opportunity of seeing each other; means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of execution are more readily combined, and opinions are maintained with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a degree of warmth and energy which written language cannot approach.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Lastly, in the exercise of the right of political association, there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is a third degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite in electoral,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bodies, and choose delegates to represent them in a central assembly.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This is, properly speaking, the application of the representative system","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to a party.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, in the first instance, a society is formed between individuals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"professing the same opinion, and the tie which keeps it together is of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a purely intellectual nature; in the second case, small assemblies are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed which only represent a fraction of the party. Lastly, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"third case, they constitute a separate nation in the midst of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation, a government within the Government. Their delegates, like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"real delegates of the majority, represent the entire collective force","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their party; and they enjoy a certain degree of that national dignity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and great influence which belong to the chosen representatives of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people. It is true that they have not the right of making the laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but they have the power of attacking those which are in being, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of drawing up beforehand those which they may afterwards cause to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adopted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If, in a people which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of freedom, or which is exposed to violent political passions, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deliberating minority, which confines itself to the contemplation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"future laws, be placed in juxtaposition to the legislative majority, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot but believe that public tranquillity incurs very great risks in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that nation. There is doubtless a very wide difference between proving,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that one law is in itself better than another and proving that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former ought to be substituted for the latter. But the imagination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,apparent to the minds of thinking men. It sometimes happens that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation is divided into two nearly equal parties, each of which affects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to represent the majority. If, in immediate contiguity to the directing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power, another power be established, which exercises almost as much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moral authority as the former, it is not to be believed that it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,long be content to speak without acting; or that it will always be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,restrained by the abstract consideration of the nature of associations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which are meant to direct but not to enforce opinions, to suggest but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not to make the laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The more we consider the independence of the press in its principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequences, the more are we convinced that it is the chief and, so to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speak, the constitutive element of freedom in the modern world. A nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is determined to remain free is therefore right in demanding the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unrestrained exercise of this independence. But the unrestrained liberty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the press. The one is at the same time less necessary and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous than the other. A nation may confine it within certain limits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without forfeiting any part of its self-control; and it may sometimes be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliged to do so in order to maintain its own authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the liberty of association for political purposes is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unbounded. An example will show in the clearest light to what an extent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this privilege is tolerated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The question of the tariff, or of free trade, produced a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manifestation of party feeling in America; the tariff was not only a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subject of debate as a matter of opinion, but it exercised a favorable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or a prejudicial influence upon several very powerful interests of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. The North attributed a great portion of its prosperity, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South all its sufferings, to this system; insomuch that for a long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time the tariff was the sole source of the political animosities which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agitated the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,private citizen of Massachusetts proposed to all the enemies of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tariff, by means of the public prints, to send delegates to Philadelphia","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in order to consult together upon the means which were most fitted to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,promote freedom of trade. This proposal circulated in a few days from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Maine to New Orleans by the power of the printing-press: the opponents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were formed on all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sides, and delegates were named. The majority of these individuals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable degree of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"celebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On October 1, 1831, this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assembly, which according to the American custom had taken the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a Convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than two hundred","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"members. Its debates were public, and they at once assumed a legislative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"character; the extent of the powers of Congress, the theories of free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"trade, and the different clauses of the tariff, were discussed in turn.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"At the end of ten days' deliberation the Convention broke up, after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"having published an address to the American people, in which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,declared:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I. That Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existing tariff was unconstitutional;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,II. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of all nations, and to that of the American people in particular.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"association has not hitherto produced, in the United States, those fatal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences which might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"right of association was imported from England, and it has always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existed in America; so that the exercise of this privilege is now,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amalgamated with the manners and customs of the people. At the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time the liberty of association is become a necessary guarantee against,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the tyranny of the majority. In the United States, as soon as a party is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"become preponderant, all public authority passes under its control; its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private supporters occupy all the places, and have all the force of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration at their disposal. As the most distinguished partisans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the other side of the question are unable to surmount the obstacles,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which exclude them from power, they require some means of establishing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the moral authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the minority to the physical power which domineers over it. Thus a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable danger.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The omnipotence of the majority appears to me to present such extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perils to the American Republics that the dangerous measure which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,used to repress it seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,here I am about to advance a proposition which may remind the reader,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of what I said before in speaking of municipal freedom: There are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no countries in which associations are more needed, to prevent the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despotism of faction or the arbitrary power of a prince, than those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,body of the nobles and the more opulent part of the community are in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves natural associations, which act as checks upon the abuses of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power. In countries in which these associations do not exist, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,private individuals are unable to create an artificial and a temporary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"substitute for them, I can imagine no permanent protection against the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most galling tyranny; and a great people may be oppressed by a small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faction, or by a single individual, with impunity.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The meeting of a great political Convention (for there are Conventions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of all kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"always a serious occurrence, even in America, and one which is never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"looked forward to, by the judicious friends of the country, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alarm. This was very perceptible in the Convention of 1831, at which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exertions of all the most distinguished members of the Assembly tended,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to moderate its language, and to restrain the subjects which it treated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within certain limits. It is probable, in fact, that the Convention of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"1831 exercised a very great influence upon the minds of the malcontents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and prepared them for the open revolt against the commercial laws of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union which took place in 1832.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for political purposes is the privilege which a people is longest in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"learning how to exercise. If it does not throw the nation into anarchy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it perpetually augments the chances of that calamity. On one point,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"however, this perilous liberty offers a security against dangers of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"another kind; in countries where associations are free, secret","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"societies are unknown. In America there are numerous factions, but no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conspiracies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Different ways in which the right of association is understood in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europe and in the United States--Different use which is made of it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for himself, is that of combining his exertions with those of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-creatures, and of acting in common with them. I am therefore led","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to conclude that the right of association is almost as inalienable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as the right of personal liberty. No legislator can attack it without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impairing the very foundations of society. Nevertheless, if the liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of association is a fruitful source of advantages and prosperity to some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by others, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the element of life may be changed into an element of destruction. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparison of the different methods which associations pursue in those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where liberty degenerates into license, may perhaps be thought useful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,both to governments and to parties.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The greater part of Europeans look upon an association as a weapon which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is to be hastily fashioned, and immediately tried in the conflict.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A society is formed for discussion, but the idea of impending action","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevails in the minds of those who constitute it: it is, in fact, an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,army; and the time given to parley serves to reckon up the strength and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to animate the courage of the host, after which they direct their march","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,against the enemy. Resources which lie within the bounds of the law may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suggest themselves to the persons who compose it as means, but never as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the only means, of success.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Such, however, is not the manner in which the right of association is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,understood in the United States. In America the citizens who form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the minority associate, in order, in the first place, to show their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"numerical strength, and so to diminish the moral authority of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority; and, in the second place, to stimulate competition, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for they always entertain hopes of drawing over their opponents to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own side, and of afterwards disposing of the supreme power in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,name. Political associations in the United States are therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peaceable in their intentions, and strictly legal in the means which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they employ; and they assert with perfect truth that they only aim at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,success by lawful expedients.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The difference which exists between the Americans and ourselves depends,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on several causes. In Europe there are numerous parties so diametrically,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opposed to the majority that they can never hope to acquire its support,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and at the same time they think that they are sufficiently strong in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves to struggle and to defend their cause. When a party of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"kind forms an association, its object is, not to conquer, but to fight.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the individuals who hold opinions very much opposed to those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the majority are no sort of impediment to its power, and all other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,parties hope to win it over to their own principles in the end. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise of the right of association becomes dangerous in proportion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the impossibility which excludes great parties from acquiring the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority. In a country like the United States, in which the differences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of opinion are mere differences of hue, the right of association may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remain unrestrained without evil consequences. The inexperience of many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the European nations in the enjoyment of liberty leads them only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to look upon the liberty of association as a right of attacking the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government. The first notion which presents itself to a party, as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as to an individual, when it has acquired a consciousness of its own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"strength, is that of violence: the notion of persuasion arises at a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"later period and is only derived from experience. The English, who are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divided into parties which differ most essentially from each other,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rarely abuse the right of association, because they have long been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accustomed to exercise it. In France the passion for war is so intense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that there is no undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State, that a man does not consider himself honored in defending it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at the risk of his life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excesses of political association in the United States is Universal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Suffrage. In countries in which universal suffrage exists the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is never doubtful, because neither party can pretend to represent that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,portion of the community which has not voted. The associations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are formed are aware, as well as the nation at large, that they do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represent the majority: this is, indeed, a condition inseparable from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their existence; for if they did represent the preponderating power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they would change the law instead of soliciting its reform. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequence of this is that the moral influence of the Government which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they attack is very much increased, and their own power is very much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enfeebled.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In Europe there are few associations which do not affect to represent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the majority, or which do not believe that they represent it. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conviction or this pretension tends to augment their force amazingly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and contributes no less to legalize their measures. Violence may seem to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be excusable in defence of the cause of oppressed right. Thus it is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the vast labyrinth of human laws, that extreme liberty sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"corrects the abuses of license, and that extreme democracy obviates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the dangers of democratic government. In Europe, associations consider","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves, in some degree, as the legislative and executive councils of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people, which is unable to speak for itself. In America, where they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only represent a minority of the nation, they argue and they petition.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The means which the associations of Europe employ are in accordance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the end which they propose to obtain. As the principal aim of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bodies is to act, and not to debate, to fight rather than to persuade,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are naturally led to adopt a form of organization which differs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the ordinary customs of civil bodies, and which assumes the habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the maxims of military life. They centralize the direction of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources as much as possible, and they intrust the power of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,party to a very small number of leaders.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The members of these associations respond to a watchword, like soldiers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on duty; they profess the doctrine of passive obedience; say rather,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that in uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judgment and free will; and the tyrannical control which these societies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise is often far more insupportable than the authority possessed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over society by the Government which they attack. Their moral force is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much diminished by these excesses, and they lose the powerful interest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is always excited by a struggle between oppressors and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppressed. The man who in given cases consents to obey his fellows with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"servility, and who submits his activity and even his opinions to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"control, can have no claim to rank as a free citizen.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans have also established certain forms of government which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the forms of the civil administration. The independence of each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual is formally recognized; the tendency of the members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"association points, as it does in the body of the community, towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same end, but they are not obliged to follow the same track. No","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one abjures the exercise of his reason and his free will; but every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one exerts that reason and that will for the benefit of a common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertaking.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subject, but although every expression which I am about to make use of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may clash, upon some one point, with the feelings of the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"parties which divide my country, I shall speak my opinion with the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perfect openness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character and the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"permanent propensities of democracy, because in Europe two conflicting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles exist, and we do not know what to attribute to the principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves, and what to refer to the passions which they bring into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collision. Such, however, is not the case in America; there the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reigns without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread and no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"injuries to avenge. In America, democracy is swayed by its own free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,propensities; its course is natural and its activity is unrestrained;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States consequently afford the most favorable opportunity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,studying its real character. And to no people can this inquiry be more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vitally interesting than to the French nation, which is blindly driven","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,onwards by a daily and irresistible impulse towards a state of things,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which may prove either despotic or republican, but which will assuredly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be democratic.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Universal Suffrage,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the States of the Union; it consequently occurs amongst different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,populations which occupy very different positions in the scale of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society. I have had opportunities of observing its effects in different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"localities, and amongst races of men who are nearly strangers to each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other by their language, their religion, and their manner of life; in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Louisiana as well as in New England, in Georgia and in Canada. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,in America frequently seclude themselves from public affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Many people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it, or to say","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without believing it, that one of the great advantages of universal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suffrage is, that it entrusts the direction of public affairs to men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who are worthy of the public confidence. They admit that the people is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unable to govern for itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"disposed to promote the welfare of the State, and that it instinctively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"designates those persons who are animated by the same good wishes, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who are the most fit to wield the supreme authority. I confess that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observations I made in America by no means coincide with these opinions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,On my arrival in the United States I was surprised to find so much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinguished talent among the subjects, and so little among the heads","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Government. It is a well-authenticated fact, that at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day the most able men in the United States are very rarely placed at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the head of affairs; and it must be acknowledged that such has been the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,result in proportion as democracy has outstepped all its former limits.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The race of American statesmen has evidently dwindled most remarkably in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the course of the last fifty years.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Several causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. It is impossible,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the people above a certain level. Whatever may be the facilities of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquiring information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of cheap science, the human mind can never be instructed and educated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without devoting a considerable space of time to those objects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,boundary is more remote in some countries and more restricted in others;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but it must exist somewhere as long as the people is constrained to work,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in order to procure the means of physical subsistence, that is to say,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as long as it retains its popular character. It is therefore quite as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficult to imagine a State in which all the citizens should be very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,well informed as a State in which they should all be wealthy; these two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulties may be looked upon as correlative. It may very readily be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,admitted that the mass of the citizens are sincerely disposed to promote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the welfare of their country; nay more, it may even be allowed that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lower classes are less apt to be swayed by considerations of personal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest than the higher orders: but it is always more or less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible for them to discern the best means of attaining the end which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they desire with sincerity. Long and patient observation, joined to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"multitude of different notions, is required to form a just estimate of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the character of a single individual; and can it be supposed that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vulgar have the power of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,penetration of genius itself? The people has neither the time nor the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means which are essential to the prosecution of an investigation of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kind: its conclusions are hastily formed from a superficial inspection,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the more prominent features of a question. Hence it often assents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the clamor of a mountebank who knows the secret of stimulating its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tastes, while its truest friends frequently fail in their exertions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Moreover, the democracy is not only deficient in that soundness of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,judgment which is necessary to select men really deserving of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confidence, but it has neither the desire nor the inclination to find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them out. It cannot be denied that democratic institutions have a very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strong tendency to promote the feeling of envy in the human heart; not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so much because they afford to every one the means of rising to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"level of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those means perpetually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disappoint the persons who employ them. Democratic institutions awaken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and foster a passion for equality which they can never entirely satisfy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This complete equality eludes the grasp of the people at the very moment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at which it thinks to hold it fast, and ""flies,"" as Pascal says, ""with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"eternal flight""; the people is excited in the pursuit of an advantage,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is more precious because it is not sufficiently remote to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. The lower orders","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are agitated by the chance of success, they are irritated by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uncertainty; and they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exhaustion of ill-success, and lastly to the acrimony of disappointment.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whatever transcends their own limits appears to be an obstacle to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"desires, and there is no kind of superiority, however legitimate it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be, which is not irksome in their sight.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads the lower,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,orders to remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of public affairs is peculiar to France. This, however, is an error; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"propensity to which I allude is not inherent in any particular nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but in democratic institutions in general; and although it may have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heightened by peculiar political circumstances, it owes its origin to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,higher cause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States the people is not disposed to hate the superior,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"classes of society; but it is not very favorably inclined towards them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and it carefully excludes them from the exercise of authority. It does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not entertain any dread of distinguished talents, but it is rarely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,captivated by them; and it awards its approbation very sparingly to such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as have risen without the popular support.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whilst the natural propensities of democracy induce the people to reject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most distinguished citizens as its rulers, these individuals are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no less apt to retire from a political career in which it is almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impossible to retain their independence, or to advance without degrading","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves. This opinion has been very candidly set forth by Chancellor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Kent, who says, in speaking with great eulogiums of that part of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution which empowers the Executive to nominate the judges: ""It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,indeed probable that the men who are best fitted to discharge the duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this high office would have too much reserve in their manners, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"too much austerity in their principles, for them to be returned by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority at an election where universal suffrage is adopted."" Such were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the opinions which were printed without contradiction in America in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,year 1830!,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suffrage is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by no means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popular choice, and that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whatever its advantages may be, this is not one of them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Causes Which May Partly Correct These Tendencies Of The Democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Contrary effects produced on peoples as well as on individuals by great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangers--Why so many distinguished men stood at the head of affairs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in America fifty years ago--Influence which the intelligence and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the manners of the people exercise upon its choice--Example of New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,England--States of the Southwest--Influence of certain laws upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,choice of the people--Election by an elected body--Its effects upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,composition of the Senate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When a State is threatened by serious dangers, the people frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,succeeds in selecting the citizens who are the most able to save it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It has been observed that man rarely retains his customary level in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,presence of very critical circumstances; he rises above or he sinks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"below his usual condition, and the same thing occurs in nations at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,large. Extreme perils sometimes quench the energy of a people instead of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stimulating it; they excite without directing its passions, and instead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of clearing they confuse its powers of perception. The Jews deluged the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,smoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of the remnant of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"host. But it is more common, both in the case of nations and in that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of individuals, to find extraordinary virtues arising from the very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imminence of the danger. Great characters are then thrown into relief,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as edifices which are concealed by the gloom of night are illuminated by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the glare of a conflagration. At those dangerous times genius no longer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abstains from presenting itself in the arena; and the people, alarmed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the perils of its situation, buries its envious passions in a short","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oblivion. Great names may then be drawn from the balloting-box.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have already observed that the American statesmen of the present day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are very inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ago. This is as much a consequence of the circumstances as of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws of the country. When America was struggling in the high cause of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence to throw off the yoke of another country, and when it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was about to usher a new nation into the world, the spirits of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants were roused to the height which their great efforts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,required. In this general excitement the most distinguished men were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ready to forestall the wants of the community, and the people clung","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to them for support, and placed them at its head. But events of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magnitude are rare, and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of affairs that our judgment must be formed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the passions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy, the intelligence and the manners of the community exercise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an influence which is not less powerful and far more permanent. This is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extremely perceptible in the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In New England the education and the liberties of the communities were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,engendered by the moral and religious principles of their founders.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Where society has acquired a sufficient degree of stability to enable it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to hold certain maxims and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are accustomed to respect intellectual superiority and to submit to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it without complaint, although they set at naught all those privileges","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which wealth and birth have introduced among mankind. The democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in New England consequently makes a more judicious choice than it does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elsewhere.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But as we descend towards the South, to those States in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the constitution of society is more modern and less strong, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instruction is less general, and where the principles of morality, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religion, and of liberty are less happily combined, we perceive that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,talents and the virtues of those who are in authority become more and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more rare.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Lastly, when we arrive at the new South-western States, in which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution of society dates but from yesterday, and presents an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agglomeration of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"persons who are invested with public authority, and we are led to ask by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"what force, independent of the legislation and of the men who direct it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State can be protected, and society be made to flourish.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"There are certain laws of a democratic nature which contribute,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nevertheless, to correct, in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democracy. On entering the House of Representatives of Washington one is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. The eye frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does not discover a man of celebrity within its walls. Its members are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost all obscure individuals whose names present no associations to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the mind: they are mostly village lawyers, men in trade, or even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,persons belonging to the lower classes of society. In a country in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"education is very general, it is said that the representatives of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people do not always know how to write correctly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"At a few yards' distance from this spot is the door of the Senate, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contains within a small space a large proportion of the celebrated men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of America. Scarcely an individual is to be perceived in it who does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not recall the idea of an active and illustrious career: the Senate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrates, and statesmen of note, whose language would at all times do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,honor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates of Europe.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"What then is the cause of this strange contrast, and why are the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able citizens to be found in one assembly rather than in the other?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Why is the former body remarkable for its vulgarity and its poverty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"talent, whilst the latter seems to enjoy a monopoly of intelligence and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of sound judgment? Both of these assemblies emanate from the people;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,both of them are chosen by universal suffrage; and no voice has hitherto,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been heard to assert in America that the Senate is hostile to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests of the people. From what cause, then, does so startling a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difference arise? The only reason which appears to me adequately to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"account for it is, that the House of Representatives is elected by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"populace directly, and that the Senate is elected by elected bodies. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole body of the citizens names the legislature of each State, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Constitution converts these legislatures into so many electoral,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bodies, which return the members of the Senate. The senators are elected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by an indirect application of universal suffrage; for the legislatures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which name them are not aristocratic or privileged bodies which exercise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the electoral franchise in their own right; but they are chosen by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"totality of the citizens; they are generally elected every year, and new","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,members may constantly be chosen who will employ their electoral rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in conformity with the wishes of the public. But this transmission of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the popular authority through an assembly of chosen men operates an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"important change in it, by refining its discretion and improving the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forms which it adopts. Men who are chosen in this manner accurately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represent the majority of the nation which governs them; but they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"represent the elevated thoughts which are current in the community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the propensities which prompt its nobler actions, rather than the petty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions which disturb or the vices which disgrace it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The time may be already anticipated at which the American Republics will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected body more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently into their system of representation, or they will incur no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,small risk of perishing miserably amongst the shoals of democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,And here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon this peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,system of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political power to the level of all classes of the people. Those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thinkers who regard this institution as the exclusive weapon of a party,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and those who fear, on the other hand, to make use of it, seem to me to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fall into as great an error in the one case as in the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Influence Which The American Democracy Has Exercised On The Laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Relating To Elections,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent crisis--When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are frequent, they keep up a degree of feverish excitement--The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans have preferred the second of these two evils--Mutability of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson on this subject.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When elections recur at long intervals the State is exposed to violent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agitation every time they take place. Parties exert themselves to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,utmost in order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and as the evil is almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences of their disappointed ambition may prove most disastrous;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if, on the other hand, the legal struggle can be repeated within a short","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"space of time, the defeated parties take patience. When elections occur","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently, their recurrence keeps society in a perpetual state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feverish excitement, and imparts a continual instability to public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, on the one hand the State is exposed to the perils of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"revolution, on the other to perpetual mutability; the former system","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"threatens the very existence of the Government, the latter is an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obstacle to all steady and consistent policy. The Americans have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preferred the second of these evils to the first; but they were led to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this conclusion by their instinct much more than by their reason; for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taste for variety is one of the characteristic passions of democracy. An,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extraordinary mutability has, by this means, been introduced into their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation. Many of the Americans consider the instability of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws as a necessary consequence of a system whose general results are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,beneficial. But no one in the United States affects to deny the fact of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this instability, or to contend that it is not a great evil.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Hamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power which might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevent, or which might at least impede, the promulgation of bad laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adds: ""It might perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"includes that of preventing good ones, and may be used to the one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,purpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the character and genius of our governments."" (Federalist, No. 73.)","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"And again in No. 62 of the same work he observes: ""The facility and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are most liable. . . . The mischievous effects of the mutability in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public councils arising from a rapid succession of new members would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fill a volume: every new election in the States is found to change,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one-half of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a change of opinions and of measures, which forfeits the respect and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confidence of other nations, poisons the blessings of liberty itself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and diminishes the attachment and reverence of the people toward a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Jefferson himself, the greatest Democrat whom the democracy of America","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has yet produced, pointed out the same evils. ""The instability of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"our laws,"" said he in a letter to Madison, ""is really a very serious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inconvenience. I think that we ought to have obviated it by deciding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that a whole year should always be allowed to elapse between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bringing in of a bill and the final passing of it. It should afterward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,public officers are remunerated--Political consequences of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Public officers in the United States are commingled with the crowd,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of citizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,costumes. This simple exterior of the persons in authority is connected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not only with the peculiarities of the American character, but with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the fundamental principles of that society. In the estimation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy a government is not a benefit, but a necessary evil. A certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"degree of power must be granted to public officers, for they would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of no use without it. But the ostensible semblance of authority is by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no means indispensable to the conduct of affairs, and it is needlessly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offensive to the susceptibility of the public. The public officers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves are well aware that they only enjoy the superiority over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their fellow-citizens which they derive from their authority upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition of putting themselves on a level with the whole community by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their manners. A public officer in the United States is uniformly civil,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accessible to all the world, attentive to all requests, and obliging","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in his replies. I was pleased by these characteristics of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government; and I was struck by the manly independence of the citizens,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who respect the office more than the officer, and who are less attached","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the emblems of authority than to the man who bears them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am inclined to believe that the influence which costumes really,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercise, in an age like that in which we live, has been a good deal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exaggerated. I never perceived that a public officer in America was the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less respected whilst he was in the discharge of his duties because his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own merit was set off by no adventitious signs. On the other hand, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very doubtful whether a peculiar dress contributes to the respect which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public characters ought to have for their own position, at least when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are not otherwise inclined to respect it. When a magistrate (and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in France such instances are not rare) indulges his trivial wit at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expense of the prisoner, or derides the predicament in which a culprit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is placed, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of office,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to see whether he would recall some portion of the natural dignity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mankind when he is reduced to the apparel of a private citizen.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A democracy may, however, allow a certain show of magisterial pomp, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"clothe its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its principles. Privileges of this kind are transitory; they belong to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the place, and are distinct from the individual: but if public officers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are not uniformly remunerated by the State, the public charges must be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entrusted to men of opulence and independence, who constitute the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,basis of an aristocracy; and if the people still retains its right,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of election, that election can only be made from a certain class of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens. When a democratic republic renders offices which had formerly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been remunerated gratuitous, it may safely be believed that the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is advancing to monarchical institutions; and when a monarchy begins to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sign that it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government. The substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself, in my opinion, sufficient to constitute a serious revolution.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in America as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one of the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercises in that country. All public services, of whatsoever nature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they may be, are paid; so that every one has not merely the right, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"also the means of performing them. Although, in democratic States, all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the citizens are qualified to occupy stations in the Government, all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are not tempted to try for them. The number and the capacities of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,candidates are more apt to restrict the choice of electors than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,connections of the candidateship.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In nations in which the principle of election extends to every place in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State no political career can, properly speaking, be said to exist.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Men are promoted as if by chance to the rank which they enjoy, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are by no means sure of retaining it. The consequence is that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tranquil times public functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States the persons who engage in the perplexities of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,life are individuals of very moderate pretensions. The pursuit of wealth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally diverts men of great talents and of great passions from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pursuit of power, and it very frequently happens that a man does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertake to direct the fortune of the State until he has discovered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his incompetence to conduct his own affairs. The vast number of very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ordinary men who occupy public stations is quite as attributable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, I am not sure that the people would return the men of superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abilities who might solicit its support, but it is certain that men of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: I here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it can be taken; I apply it to all the officers to whom the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,execution of the laws is intrusted.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In despotic States the fortune of no citizen is secure; and public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers are not more safe than private individuals. The sovereign, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has under his control the lives, the property, and sometimes the honor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the men whom he employs, does not scruple to allow them a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"latitude of action, because he is convinced that they will not use it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to his prejudice. In despotic States the sovereign is so attached to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercise of his power, that he dislikes the constraint even of his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regulations; and he is well pleased that his agents should follow a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"somewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be certain that their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,actions will never counteract his desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In democracies, as the majority has every year the right of depriving","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the officers whom it has appointed of their power, it has no reason","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to fear any abuse of their authority. As the people is always able,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to signify its wishes to those who conduct the Government, it prefers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,leaving them to make their own exertions to prescribing an invariable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rule of conduct which would at once fetter their activity and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,popular authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rule of a democracy the arbitrary power of the magistrate must be still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,greater than in despotic States. In the latter the sovereign has the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power of punishing all the faults with which he becomes acquainted, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it would be vain for him to hope to become acquainted with all those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which are committed. In the former the sovereign power is not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supreme, but it is universally present. The American functionaries are,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in point of fact, much more independent in the sphere of action which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the law traces out for them than any public officer in Europe. Very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,frequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply pointed out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to them, and the choice of the means is left to their own discretion.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In New England, for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to draw up the list of persons who are to serve on the jury; the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rule which is laid down to guide them in their choice is that they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to select citizens possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reputation. *b In France the lives and liberties of the subjects would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be thought to be in danger if a public officer of any kind was entrusted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with so formidable a right. In New England the same magistrates are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"empowered to post the names of habitual drunkards in public-houses, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to prohibit the inhabitants of a town from supplying them with liquor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*c A censorial power of this excessive kind would be revolting to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the population of the most absolute monarchies; here, however, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary determination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the magistrate as in democratic republics, because this arbitrary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power is unattended by any alarming consequences. It may even be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,asserted that the freedom of the magistrate increases as the elective,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"franchise is extended, and as the duration of the time of office","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is shortened. Hence arises the great difficulty which attends the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conversion of a democratic republic into a monarchy. The magistrate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ceases to be elective, but he retains the rights and the habits of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elected officer, which lead directly to despotism.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is only in limited monarchies that the law, which prescribes the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sphere in which public officers are to act, superintends all their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures. The cause of this may be easily detected. In limited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarchies the power is divided between the King and the people, both","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of whom are interested in the stability of the magistrate. The King,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does not venture to place the public officers under the control of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other hand, the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"oppress the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the Crown; they cannot therefore be said to depend on either one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or the other. The same cause which induces the king and the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to render public officers independent suggests the necessity of such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,securities as may prevent their independence from encroaching upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the authority of the former and the liberties of the latter. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are interested in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,that the acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"speak, oral and traditionary. But little is committed to writing, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,be more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,have recourse to the history of other nations in order to learn anything,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the people which now inhabits them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for what occurred before his time. No methodical system is pursued; no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,archives are formed; and no documents are brought together when it would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be very easy to do so. Where they exist, little store is set upon them;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and I have amongst my papers several original public documents which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were given to me in answer to some of my inquiries. In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society seems to live from hand to mouth, like an army in the field.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, the art of administration may undoubtedly be ranked as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a science, and no sciences can be improved if the discoveries and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observations of successive generations are not connected together in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the order in which they occur. One man, in the short space of his life","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remarks a fact; another conceives an idea; the former invents a means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of execution, the latter reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mankind gathers the fruits of individual experience upon its way,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and gradually forms the sciences. But the persons who conduct the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration in America can seldom afford any instruction to each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other; and when they assume the direction of society, they simply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possess those attainments which are most widely disseminated in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community, and no experience peculiar to themselves. Democracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"carried to its furthest limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government; and for this reason it is better adapted to a people already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,versed in the conduct of an administration than to a nation which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uninitiated in public affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the science of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration. Although a democratic government is founded upon a very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"simple and natural principle, it always presupposes the existence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a high degree of culture and enlightenment in society. *d At the first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The question would be one of easy solution if we were to attempt to draw,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a parallel between a democratic republic and an absolute monarchy. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public expenditure would be found to be more considerable under the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former than under the latter; such is the case with all free States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,compared to those which are not so. It is certain that despotism ruins,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals by preventing them from producing wealth, much more than by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,depriving them of the wealth they have produced; it dries up the source,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of riches, whilst it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which are favored by free institutions invariably find that their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resources increase even more rapidly than their taxes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"My present object is to compare free nations to each other, and to point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Communities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to certain fixed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rules in their formation which they cannot evade. They are composed of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain elements which are common to them at all times and under all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances. The people may always be mentally divided into three,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinct classes. The first of these classes consists of the wealthy;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the second, of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"composed of those who have little or no property, and who subsist more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,especially by the work which they perform for the two superior orders.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The proportion of the individuals who are included in these three,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divisions may vary according to the condition of society, but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,divisions themselves can never be obliterated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peculiar to its own propensities upon the administration of the finances,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the State. If the first of the three exclusively possesses the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative power, it is probable that it will not be sparing of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public funds, because the taxes which are levied on a large fortune only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tend to diminish the sum of superfluous enjoyment, and are, in point of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact, but little felt. If the second class has the power of making the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws, it will certainly not be lavish of taxes, because nothing is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so onerous as a large impost which is levied upon a small income.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The government of the middle classes appears to me to be the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"economical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most generous, of free governments.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But let us now suppose that the legislative authority is vested in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the lowest orders: there are two striking reasons which show that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tendency of the expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish. As the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great majority of those who create the laws are possessed of no property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon which taxes can be imposed, all the money which is spent for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community appears to be spent to their advantage, at no cost of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,own; and those who are possessed of some little property readily find,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means of regulating the taxes so that they are burdensome to the wealthy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and profitable to the poor, although the rich are unable to take the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the power of making the laws no great economy of public expenditure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ought to be expected: that expenditure will always be considerable;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"either because the taxes do not weigh upon those who levy them, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because they are levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"classes. In other words, the government of the democracy is the only one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,under which the power which lays on taxes escapes the payment of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote e: The word poor is used here, and throughout the remainder","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of this chapter, in a relative, not in an absolute sense. Poor men in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America would often appear rich in comparison with the poor of Europe;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but they may with propriety by styled poor in comparison with their more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affluent countrymen.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true interest of the people is indissolubly connected with that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wealthier portion of the community, since it cannot but suffer by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,severe measures to which it resorts. But is it not the true interest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"kings to render their subjects happy, and the true interest of nobles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to admit recruits into their order on suitable grounds? If remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages had power to prevail over the passions and the exigencies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the moment, no such thing as a tyrannical sovereign or an exclusive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy could ever exist.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Again, it may be objected that the poor are never invested with the sole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power of making the laws; but I reply, that wherever universal suffrage","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has been established the majority of the community unquestionably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercises the legislative authority; and if it be proved that the poor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"always constitute the majority, it may be added, with perfect truth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that in the countries in which they possess the elective franchise they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possess the sole power of making laws. But it is certain that in all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations of the world the greater number has always consisted of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"persons who hold no property, or of those whose property is insufficient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to exempt them from the necessity of working in order to procure an easy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsistence. Universal suffrage does therefore, in point of fact, invest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the poor with the government of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The disastrous influence which popular authority may sometimes exercise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the finances of a State was very clearly seen in some of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic republics of antiquity, in which the public treasure was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exhausted in order to relieve indigent citizens, or to supply the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,games and theatrical amusements of the populace. It is true that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representative system was then very imperfectly known, and that, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the present time, the influence of popular passion is less felt in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conduct of public affairs; but it may be believed that the delegate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"will in the end conform to the principles of his constituents, and favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their propensities as much as their interests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The extravagance of democracy is, however, less to be dreaded in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proportion as the people acquires a share of property, because on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one hand the contributions of the rich are then less needed, and, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the other, it is more difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests of the lower classes. On this account universal suffrage,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"would be less dangerous in France than in England, because in the latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country the property on which taxes may be levied is vested in fewer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hands. America, where the great majority of the citizens possess some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fortune, is in a still more favorable position than France.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There are still further causes which may increase the sum of public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expenditure in democratic countries. When the aristocracy governs, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individuals who conduct the affairs of State are exempted by their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,station in society from every kind of privation; they are contented with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their position; power and renown are the objects for which they strive;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and, as they are placed far above the obscurer throng of citizens, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,do not always distinctly perceive how the well-being of the mass of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people ought to redound to their own honor. They are not indeed callous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the sufferings of the poor, but they cannot feel those miseries as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acutely as if they were themselves partakers of them. Provided that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are satisfied, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,demand nothing further from the Government. An aristocracy is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intent upon the means of maintaining its influence than upon the means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of improving its condition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When, on the contrary, the people is invested with the supreme","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of society to seek for perpetual ameliorations. A thousand different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,objects are subjected to improvement; the most trivial details are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sought out as susceptible of amendment; and those changes which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accompanied with considerable expense are more especially advocated,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"since the object is to render the condition of the poor more tolerable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who cannot pay for themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Moreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excitement and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engender a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"multitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with expense.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In monarchies and aristocracies the natural taste which the rulers have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for power and for renown is stimulated by the promptings of ambition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they are frequently incited by these temptations to very costly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertakings. In democracies, where the rulers labor under privations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they can only be courted by such means as improve their well-being, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these improvements cannot take place without a sacrifice of money. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a people begins to reflect upon its situation, it discovers a multitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of wants to which it had not before been subject, and to satisfy these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exigencies recourse must be had to the coffers of the State. Hence it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arises that the public charges increase in proportion as civilization,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spreads, and that imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The last cause which frequently renders a democratic government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dearer than any other is, that a democracy does not always succeed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moderating its expenditure, because it does not understand the art of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,being economical. As the designs which it entertains are frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changed, and the agents of those designs are still more frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"removed, its undertakings are often ill conducted or left unfinished: in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the former case the State spends sums out of all proportion to the end,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense itself is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unprofitable. *f,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the democracies those who establish high salaries have no chance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,profiting by them--Tendency of the American democracy to increase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the salaries of subordinate officers and to lower those of the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,important functionaries--Reason of this--Comparative statement of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,salaries of public officers in the United States and in France.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There is a powerful reason which usually induces democracies to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,economize upon the salaries of public officers. As the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens who dispense the remuneration is extremely large in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countries, so the number of persons who can hope to be benefited by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"receipt of it is comparatively small. In aristocratic countries, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, the individuals who fix high salaries have almost always a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vague hope of profiting by them. These appointments may be looked upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as a capital which they create for their own use, or at least as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resource for their children.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It must, however, be allowed that a democratic State is most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,parsimonious towards its principal agents. In America the secondary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officers are much better paid, and the dignitaries of the administration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much worse, than they are elsewhere.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These opposite effects result from the same cause; the people fixes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the salaries of the public officers in both cases; and the scale of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remuneration is determined by the consideration of its own wants. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,held to be fair that the servants of the public should be placed in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same easy circumstances as the public itself; *g but when the question,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"turns upon the salaries of the great officers of State, this rule","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fails, and chance alone can guide the popular decision. The poor have no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adequate conception of the wants which the higher classes of society may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,feel. The sum which is scanty to the rich appears enormous to the poor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,man whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of life; and in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"estimation the Governor of a State, with his twelve or fifteen hundred","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dollars a year, is a very fortunate and enviable being. *h If you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertake to convince him that the representative of a great people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ought to be able to maintain some show of splendor in the eyes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign nations, he will perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reflects on his own humble dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of his wearisome toil, he remembers all that he could do with a salary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which you say is insufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the sight of such uncommon wealth. Besides, the secondary public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"officer is almost on a level with the people, whilst the others are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"raised above it. The former may therefore excite his interest, but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter begins to arouse his envy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote g: The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are placed in the United States result also from another cause, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is independent of the general tendencies of democracy; every kind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private business is very lucrative, and the State would not be served at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all if it did not pay its servants. The country is in the position of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a commercial undertaking, which is obliged to sustain an expensive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have perhaps done wrong in selecting France as my standard of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparison. In France the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an ever-increasing influence upon the Government, and the Chambers show","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a disposition to raise the low salaries and to lower the principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ones. Thus, the Minister of Finance, who received 160,000 fr. under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Empire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the Directeurs-generaux of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Finance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only 20,000 fr. [This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparison is based on the state of things existing in France and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States in 1831. It has since materially altered in both,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countries, but not so much as to impugn the truth of the author's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observation.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Under the rule of an aristocracy it frequently happens, on the contrary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that whilst the high officers are receiving munificent salaries, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inferior ones have not more than enough to procure the necessaries of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,life. The reason of this fact is easily discoverable from causes very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,analogous to those to which I have just alluded. If a democracy is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unable to conceive the pleasures of the rich or to witness them without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"envy, an aristocracy is slow to understand, or, to speak more correctly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is unacquainted with, the privations of the poor. The poor man is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,(if we use the term aright) the fellow of the rich one; but he is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,being of another species. An aristocracy is therefore apt to care but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,little for the fate of its subordinate agents; and their salaries are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only raised when they refuse to perform their service for too scanty a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remuneration.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is the parsimonious conduct of democracy towards its principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,officers which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,propensities than any which it really possesses. It is true that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scarcely allows the means of honorable subsistence to the individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who conduct its affairs; but enormous sums are lavished to meet the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the people. *j The money,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"raised by taxation may be better employed, but it is not saved. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general, democracy gives largely to the community, and very sparingly to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those who govern it. The reverse is the case in aristocratic countries,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,where the money of the State is expended to the profit of the persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who are at the head of affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"These are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. Others, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the contrary, are attached to more retiring pleasures, and seem almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ashamed of appearing to be pleased. In some countries the highest value,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is set upon the beauty of public edifices; in others the productions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"art are treated with indifference, and everything which is unproductive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"nations is composed of several distinct elements, of which population","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is the first, real property the second, and personal property the third.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The first of these three elements may be discovered without difficulty.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Amongst civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate census of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the inhabitants; but the two others cannot be determined with so much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,facility. It is difficult to take an exact account of all the lands in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a country which are under cultivation, with their natural or their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"personal property which is at the disposal of a nation, and which eludes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the strictest analysis by the diversity and the number of shapes under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which it may occur. And, indeed, we find that the most ancient civilized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations of Europe, including even those in which the administration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is most central, have not succeeded, as yet, in determining the exact","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition of their wealth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the attempt has never been made; for how would such an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,investigation be possible in a country where society has not yet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,settled into habits of regularity and tranquillity; where the national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government is not assisted by a multiple of agents whose exertions it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can command and direct to one sole end; and where statistics are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"studied, because no one is able to collect the necessary documents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or to find time to peruse them? Thus the primary elements of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,calculations which have been made in France cannot be obtained in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union; the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown; the property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the former is not accurately determined, and no means exist of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,computing that of the latter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"necessary term of the comparison, and I confine myself to a computation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the actual amount of taxation, without investigating the relation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which subsists between the taxation and the revenue. But the reader will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,here lay down for my researches.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It cannot be doubted that the central administration of France, assisted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by all the public officers who are at its disposal, might determine with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the citizens. But this investigation, which no private individual can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertake, has not hitherto been completed by the French Government, or,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at least, its results have not been made public. We are acquainted with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the sum total of the charges of the State; we know the amount of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,departmental expenditure; but the expenses of the communal divisions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have not been computed, and the amount of the public expenses of France","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is consequently unknown.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the difficulties are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,multiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes an exact return of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amount of its expenditure; the budgets of the four and twenty States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,furnish similar returns of their revenues; but the expenses incident to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the affairs of the counties and the townships are unknown. *k,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote k: The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Union, the States, the Counties, and the Townships having each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,severally their own. During my stay in America I made every endeavor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to discover the amount of the public expenditure in the townships and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"counties of the principal States of the Union, and I readily obtained","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the budget of the larger townships, but I found it quite impossible to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"procure that of the smaller ones. I possess, however, some documents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"relating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"curious. I have to thank Mr. Richards, Mayor of Philadelphia, for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"budgets of thirteen of the counties of Pennsylvania, viz., Lebanon,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Centre, Franklin, Fayette, Montgomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Alleghany, Columbia, Northampton, Northumberland, and Philadelphia,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for the year 1830. Their population at that time consisted of 495,207","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants. On looking at the map of Pennsylvania, it will be seen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction, and so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a country, that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,average of the financial state of the counties of Pennsylvania in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650, or nearly 75 cents for each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"year about $2.55 towards the Union, and about 75 cents to the State of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Pennsylvania, it appears that they each contributed as their share","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of all the public expenses (except those of the townships) the sum of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"$4.05. This calculation is doubly incomplete, as it applies only to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,single year and to one part of the public charges; but it has at least,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the merit of not being conjectural.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The authority of the Federal government cannot oblige the provincial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governments to throw any light upon this point; and even if these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it may be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,satisfactory answer. Independently of the natural difficulties of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"task, the political organization of the country would act as a hindrance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the success of their efforts. The county and town magistrates are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appointed by the authorities of the State, and they are not subjected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to their control. It is therefore very allowable to suppose that, if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State was desirous of obtaining the returns which we require, its design","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate officers whom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it would be obliged to employ. *l It is, in point of fact, useless to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inquire what the Americans might do to forward this inquiry, since it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is certain that they have hitherto done nothing at all. There does not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exist a single individual at the present day, in America or in Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who can inform us what each citizen of the Union annually contributes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the public charges of the nation. *m [Footnote l: Those who have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attempted to draw a comparison between the expenses of France and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America have at once perceived that no such comparison could be drawn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the total expenditure of the two countries; but they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,endeavored to contrast detached portions of this expenditure. It may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,readily be shown that this second system is not at all less defective,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than the first. If I attempt to compare the French budget with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"budget of the Union, it must be remembered that the latter embraces much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fewer objects than then central Government of the former country, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the expenditure must consequently be much smaller. If I contrast,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the budgets of the Departments with those of the States which constitute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Union, it must be observed that, as the power and control exercised","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the States is much greater than that which is exercised by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Departments, their expenditure is also more considerable. As for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"budgets of the counties, nothing of the kind occurs in the French","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"system of finances; and it is, again, doubtful whether the corresponding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expenses should be referred to the budget of the State or to those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the municipal divisions. Municipal expenses exist in both countries,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but they are not always analogous. In America the townships discharge a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,variety of offices which are reserved in France to the Departments or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the State. It may, moreover, be asked what is to be understood by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,municipal expenses of America. The organization of the municipal bodies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or townships differs in the several States. Are we to be guided by what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occurs in New England or in Georgia, in Pennsylvania or in the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Illinois? A kind of analogy may very readily be perceived between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain budgets in the two countries; but as the elements of which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are composed always differ more or less, no fair comparison can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be instituted between them. [The same difficulty exists, perhaps to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"greater degree at the present time, when the taxation of America has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,largely increased.--1874.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote m: Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"French and American citizen to the coffers of the State, we should only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,come at a portion of the truth. Governments do not only demand supplies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of money, but they call for personal services, which may be looked upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as equivalent to a given sum. When a State raises an army, besides the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pay of the troops, which is furnished by the entire nation, each soldier","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must give up his time, the value of which depends on the use he might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,make of it if he were not in the service. The same remark applies to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,militia; the citizen who is in the militia devotes a certain portion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace, and he does in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reality surrender to the State those earnings which he is prevented from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gaining. Many other instances might be cited in addition to these. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governments of France and of America both levy taxes of this kind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which weigh upon the citizens; but who can estimate with accuracy their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,relative amount in the two countries?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France. The French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government contracts certain obligations which do not exist in America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and vice versa. The French Government pays the clergy; in America the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,voluntary principle prevails. In America there is a legal provision for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the poor; in France they are abandoned to the charity of the public. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,French public officers are paid by a fixed salary; in America they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,allowed certain perquisites. In France contributions in kind take place,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,on very few roads; in America upon almost all the thoroughfares: in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the former country the roads are free to all travellers; in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter turnpikes abound. All these differences in the manner in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contributions are levied in the two countries enhance the difficulty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparing their expenditure; for there are certain expenses which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens would not be subject to, or which would at any rate be much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less considerable, if the State did not take upon itself to act in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,name of the public.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Hence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,social expenditure than it is to estimate the relative wealth of France,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and America. I will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparison; for when statistics are not based upon computations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are strictly accurate, they mislead instead of guiding aright. The mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactness, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevails even in the misstatements of science, and it adopts with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confidence errors which are dressed in the forms of mathematical truth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"We abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the hope of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"meeting with data of another kind. In the absence of positive documents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we may form an opinion as to the proportion which the taxation of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people bears to its real prosperity, by observing whether its external","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appearance is flourishing; whether, after having discharged the calls of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State, the poor man retains the means of subsistence, and the rich","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the means of enjoyment; and whether both classes are contented with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their position, seeking, however, to ameliorate it by perpetual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exertions, so that industry is never in want of capital, nor capital","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unemployed by industry. The observer who draws his inferences from these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"signs will, undoubtedly, be led to the conclusion that the American of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States contributes a much smaller portion of his income to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State than the citizen of France. Nor, indeed, can the result be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,otherwise.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A portion of the French debt is the consequence of two successive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,invasions; and the Union has no similar calamity to fear. A nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,placed upon the continent of Europe is obliged to maintain a large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,standing army; the isolated position of the Union enables it to have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only 6,000 soldiers. The French have a fleet of 300 sail; the Americans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have 52 vessels. *n How, then, can the inhabitants of the Union be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,called upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of France?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,No parallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,differently situated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote n: See the details in the Budget of the French Minister of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"the public debt of the United States in 1870, caused by the Civil War,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amounted to $2,480,672,427; that of France was more than doubled by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extravagance of the Second Empire and by the war of 1870.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is by examining what actually takes place in the Union, and not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by comparing the Union with France, that we may discover whether the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American Government is really economical. On casting my eyes over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different republics which form the confederation, I perceive that their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Governments lack perseverance in their undertakings, and that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise no steady control over the men whom they employ. Whence I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,naturally infer that they must often spend the money of the people to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no purpose, or consume more of it than is really necessary to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertakings. Great efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"origin of society, to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"open the career of power to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and comfort amongst them. The poor are maintained, immense sums are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"annually devoted to public instruction, all services whatsoever are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remunerated, and the most subordinate agents are liberally paid. If","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this kind of government appears to me to be useful and rational, I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nevertheless constrained to admit that it is expensive.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Wherever the poor direct public affairs and dispose of the national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources, it appears certain that, as they profit by the expenditure of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State, they are apt to augment that expenditure.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"computations, and without hazarding a comparison which might prove","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incorrect, that the democratic government of the Americans is not a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cheap government, as is sometimes asserted; and I have no hesitation in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"predicting that, if the people of the United States is ever involved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in serious difficulties, its taxation will speedily be increased to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rate of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the monarchies of Europe. *o,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to facilitate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,corruption. In aristocratic governments the individuals who are placed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the head of affairs are rich men, who are solely desirous of power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In democracies statesmen are poor, and they have their fortunes to make.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The consequence is that in aristocratic States the rulers are rarely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accessible to corruption, and have very little craving for money; whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the reverse is the case in democratic nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of affairs are possessed of considerable wealth, and as the number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"persons by whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government is, if I may use the expression, put up to a sort of auction.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In democracies, on the contrary, those who are covetous of power are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very seldom wealthy, and the number of citizens who confer that power is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extremely great. Perhaps in democracies the number of men who might be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bought is by no means smaller, but buyers are rarely to be met with;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and, besides, it would be necessary to buy so many persons at once that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the attempt is rendered nugatory.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Many of the men who have been in the administration in France during,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the last forty years have been accused of making their fortunes at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the expense of the State or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,addressed to the public characters of the ancient monarchy. But in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"France the practice of bribing electors is almost unknown, whilst it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,notoriously and publicly carried on in England. In the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I never heard a man accused of spending his wealth in corrupting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the populace; but I have often heard the probity of public officers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,questioned; still more frequently have I heard their success attributed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to low intrigues and immoral practices.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If, then, the men who conduct the government of an aristocracy sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"endeavor to corrupt the people, the heads of a democracy are themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,corrupt. In the former case the morality of the people is directly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assailed; in the latter an indirect influence is exercised upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people which is still more to be dreaded.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the suspicion of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the Government to the base practices of which they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accused. They thus afford an example which must prove discouraging,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the struggles of virtuous independence, and must foster the secret","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,calculations of a vicious ambition. If it be asserted that evil passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are displayed in all ranks of society, that they ascend the throne by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hereditary right, and that despicable characters are to be met with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy, this objection has but little weight in my estimation. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,corruption of men who have casually risen to power has a coarse and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vulgar infection in it which renders it contagious to the multitude. On,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the contrary, there is a kind of aristocratic refinement and an air of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"grandeur in the depravity of the great, which frequently prevent it from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spreading abroad.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,their equal is to-day their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are themselves less virtuous and less talented than he was. They are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore led (and not unfrequently their conjecture is a correct one),"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,States are so opposed to compulsory enlistment that I do not imagine it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can ever be sanctioned by the laws. What is termed the conscription,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in France is assuredly the heaviest tax upon the population of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country; yet how could a great continental war be carried on without it?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans have not adopted the British impressment of seamen, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they have nothing which corresponds to the French system of maritime,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conscription; the navy, as well as the merchant service, is supplied","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by voluntary service. But it is not easy to conceive how a people can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sustain a great maritime war without having recourse to one or the other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of these two systems. Indeed, the Union, which has fought with some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"honor upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous fleet, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the equipment of the small number of American vessels has always been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excessively expensive.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have heard American statesmen confess that the Union will have great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas without adopting the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is incontestable that in times of danger a free people displays far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more energy than one which is not so. But I incline to believe that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this is more especially the case in those free nations in which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic element preponderates. Democracy appears to me to be much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"better adapted for the peaceful conduct of society, or for an occasional","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged endurance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the storms which beset the political existence of nations. The reason,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is very evident; it is enthusiasm which prompts men to expose themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to dangers and privations, but they will not support them long without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reflection. There is more calculation, even in the impulses of bravery,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than is generally attributed to them; and although the first efforts are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suggested by passion, perseverance is maintained by a distinct regard of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the purpose in view. A portion of what we value is exposed, in order to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,save the remainder.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judgment and an enlightened experience, which is most frequently wanting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in democracies. The populace is more apt to feel than to reason; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if its present sufferings are great, it is to be feared that the still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,less persevering than those of an aristocracy. Not only are the lower,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,classes less awakened than the higher orders to the good or evil chances,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the future, but they are liable to suffer far more acutely from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"present privations. The noble exposes his life, indeed, but the chance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of glory is equal to the chance of harm. If he sacrifices a large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"portion of his income to the State, he deprives himself for a time of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the pleasures of affluence; but to the poor man death is embellished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"subduing the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conspicuous in the most trivial occurrences of the United States. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, which is surrounded by flatterers, has great difficulty in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surmounting its inclinations, and whenever it is solicited to undergo a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"privation or any kind of inconvenience, even to attain an end which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sanctioned by its own rational conviction, it almost always refuses to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comply at first. The deference of the Americans to the laws has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been very justly applauded; but it must be added that in America the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislation is made by the people and for the people. Consequently, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States the law favors those classes which are most interested,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in evading it elsewhere. It may therefore be supposed that an offensive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"law, which should not be acknowledged to be one of immediate utility,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would either not be enacted or would not be obeyed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America there is no law against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,and murders are of very frequent occurrence. This arises from the rude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those deserts, who do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"its true interests. This is frequently true, although a democracy is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more liable to error than a monarch or a body of nobles; the chances of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its regaining the right path when once it has acknowledged its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"bequest to the country: ""The great rule of conduct for us in regard to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or enmities. Our detached and distant situation invites and enables,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest, guided by justice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? It is our true policy to steer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it; therefore, let","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"to the capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,policy of the United States. As the Union takes no part in the affairs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"position as by the line of policy which it has chosen, and it is neither","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,called upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflicting interests of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,within the bosom of the future.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Union is free from all pre-existing obligations, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of Europe, without being obliged, as they are, to make the best of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"past, and to adapt it to their present circumstances; or to accept","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that immense inheritance which they derive from their forefathers--an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inheritance of glory mingled with calamities, and of alliances","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conflicting with national antipathies. The foreign policy of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"future history of the nation, and for the present it consists more in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at present, what degree","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of sagacity the American democracy will display in the conduct of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign policy of the country; and upon this point its adversaries, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"well as its advocates, must suspend their judgment. As for myself I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no hesitation in avowing my conviction, that it is most especially in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the conduct of foreign relations that democratic governments appear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,me to be decidedly inferior to governments carried on upon different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principles. Experience, instruction, and habit may almost always succeed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in creating a species of practical discretion in democracies, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,science of the daily occurrences of life which is called good sense.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Good sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of society; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amongst a people whose education has been provided for, the advantages","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of democratic liberty in the internal affairs of the country may more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than compensate for the evils inherent in a democratic government. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,such is not always the case in the mutual relations of foreign nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Foreign politics demand scarcely any of those qualities which a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the perfect use","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of almost all those faculties in which it is deficient. Democracy is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,favorable to the increase of the internal resources of the State; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tends to diffuse a moderate independence; it promotes the growth of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public spirit, and fortifies the respect which is entertained for law in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all classes of society; and these are advantages which only exercise an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,indirect influence over the relations which one people bears to another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But a democracy is unable to regulate the details of an important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertaking, to persevere in a design, and to work out its execution in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the presence of serious obstacles. It cannot combine its measures with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"secrecy, and it will not await their consequences with patience. These","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are qualities which more especially belong to an individual or to an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy; and they are precisely the means by which an individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people attains to a predominant position.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If, on the contrary, we observe the natural defects of aristocracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we shall find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,direction of the external affairs of a State. The capital fault of which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocratic bodies may be accused is that they are more apt to contrive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own advantage than that of the mass of the people. In foreign,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,politics it is rare for the interest of the aristocracy to be in any way,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinct from that of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The propensity which democracies have to obey the impulse of passion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rather than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for the gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America on the breaking out of the French Revolution. It was then as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,evident to the simplest capacity as it is at the present time that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest of the Americans forbade them to take any part in the contest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which was about to deluge Europe with blood, but which could by no means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,injure the welfare of their own country. Nevertheless the sympathies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people declared themselves with so much violence in behalf of France,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that nothing but the inflexible character of Washington, and the immense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"popularity which he enjoyed, could have prevented the Americans from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"declaring war against England. And even then, the exertions which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the austere reason of that great man made to repress the generous but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imprudent passions of his fellow-citizens, very nearly deprived him of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the sole recompense which he had ever claimed--that of his country's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"love. The majority then reprobated the line of policy which he adopted,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and which has since been unanimously approved by the nation. *s If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution and the favor of the public had not entrusted the direction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the foreign affairs of the country to Washington, it is certain that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American nation would at that time have taken the very measures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it now condemns.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote s: See the fifth volume of Marshall's ""Life of Washington."" In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a government constituted like that of the United States, he says,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""it is impossible for the chief magistrate, however firm he may be, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppose for any length of time the torrent of popular opinion; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevalent opinion of that day seemed to incline to war. In fact, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the session of Congress held at the time, it was frequently seen that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Washington had lost the majority in the House of Representatives."" The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,of the administration were declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,France and under the influence of Britain; that they were a paper,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,executing vast designs--from the Romans to the English--have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governed by aristocratic institutions. Nor will this be a subject of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wonder when we recollect that nothing in the world has so absolute a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fixity of purpose as an aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,his perseverance in his designs may be shaken--besides which a king is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not immortal--but an aristocratic body is too numerous to be led astray,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,readily to the intoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,What The Real Advantages Are Which American Society Derives From The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government Of The Democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Before I enter upon the subject of the present chapter I am induced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to remind the reader of what I have more than once adverted to in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,course of this book. The political institutions of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appear to me to be one of the forms of government which a democracy may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adopt; but I do not regard the American Constitution as the best, or as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the only one, which a democratic people may establish. In showing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantages which the Americans derive from the government of democracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am therefore very far from meaning, or from believing, that similar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages can only be obtained from the same laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,only to be discerned by long observation--Democracy in America often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inexpert, but the general tendency of the laws advantageous--In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American democracy public officers have no permanent interests distinct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from those of the majority--Result of this state of things.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government may very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,readily be discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instances, whilst its beneficial influence is less perceptibly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercised. A single glance suffices to detect its evil consequences, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its good qualities can only be discerned by long observation. The laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the American democracy are frequently defective or incomplete; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sometimes attack vested rights, or give a sanction to others which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dangerous to the community; but even if they were good, the frequent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changes which they undergo would be an evil. How comes it, then, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American republics prosper and maintain their position?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the consideration of laws a distinction must be carefully observed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the end at which they aim and the means by which they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"directed to that end, between their absolute and their relative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excellence. If it be the intention of the legislator to favor the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"view with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the law may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be well drawn up, although its purpose be bad; and the more efficacious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Democratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possible number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"concentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a democracy in the conduct of its legislation is useful to a greater,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of citizens than that of an aristocracy. This is, however, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sum total of its advantages.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Aristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a self-control which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"protects them from the errors of temporary excitement, and they form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lasting designs which they mature with the assistance of favorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opportunities. Aristocratic government proceeds with the dexterity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,art; it understands how to make the collective force of all its laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,converge at the same time to a given point. Such is not the case with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective or inopportune.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Let us now imagine a community so organized by nature, or by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution, that it can support the transitory action of bad laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and that it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the legislation: we shall then be able to conceive that a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, notwithstanding its defects, will be most fitted to conduce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the prosperity of this community. This is precisely what has occurred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the United States; and I repeat, what I have before remarked, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great advantage of the Americans consists in their being able to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commit faults which they may afterward repair.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,An analogous observation may be made respecting public officers. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is easy to perceive that the American democracy frequently errs in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the choice of the individuals to whom it entrusts the power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration; but it is more difficult to say why the State prospers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"under their rule. In the first place it is to be remarked, that if in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic State the governors have less honesty and less capacity than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elsewhere, the governed, on the other hand, are more enlightened and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more attentive to their interests. As the people in democracies is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incessantly vigilant in its affairs and more jealous of its rights,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it prevents its representatives from abandoning that general line of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conduct which its own interest prescribes. In the second place, it must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his power, he possesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,yet another reason which is still more general and conclusive. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no doubt of importance to the welfare of nations that they should be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governed by men of talents and virtue; but it is perhaps still more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,important that the interests of those men should not differ from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests of the community at large; for, if such were the case, virtues","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a high order might become useless, and talents might be turned to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a bad account. I say that it is important that the interests of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,persons in authority should not conflict with or oppose the interests of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the community at large; but I do not insist upon their having the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests as the whole population, because I am not aware that such a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state of things ever existed in any country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,No political form has hitherto been discovered which is equally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,favorable to the prosperity and the development of all the classes into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which society is divided. These classes continue to form, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a certain number of distinct nations in the same nation; and experience,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has shown that it is no less dangerous to place the fate of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,classes exclusively in the hands of any one of them than it is to make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one people the arbiter of the destiny of another. When the rich alone,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"govern, the interest of the poor is always endangered; and when the poor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"make the laws, that of the rich incurs very serious risks. The advantage","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of democracy does not consist, therefore, as has sometimes been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"asserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in contributing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the well-being of the greatest possible number.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States are frequently inferior, both in point of capacity and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"morality, to those whom aristocratic institutions would raise to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power. But their interest is identified and confounded with that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority of their fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impossible that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact, which only occurs during the short period for which he is elected.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Corruption and incapacity do not act as common interests, which may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,connect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrate will not concert his measures with another magistrate, simply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because that individual is as corrupt and as incapable as himself; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these two men will never unite their endeavors to promote the corruption,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and inaptitude of their remote posterity. The ambition and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manoeuvres of the one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The vices of a magistrate, in democratic states, are usually peculiar to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his own person.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the interest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the interests","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the majority, is very frequently distinct from them. This interest is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the common and lasting bond which unites them together; it induces them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to attain an end","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which does not always ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number; and it serves not only to connect the persons in authority,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but to unite them to a considerable portion of the community, since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a numerous body of citizens belongs to the aristocracy, without being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,invested with official functions. The aristocratic magistrate is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore constantly supported by a portion of the community, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the Government of which he is a member.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The common purpose which connects the interest of the magistrates in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracies with that of a portion of their contemporaries identifies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it with that of future generations; their influence belongs to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,future as much as to the present. The aristocratic magistrate is urged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the same time toward the same point by the passions of the community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by his own, and I may almost add by those of his posterity. Is it, then,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wonderful that he does not resist such repeated impulses? And indeed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracies are often carried away by the spirit of their order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously fashion society to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The English aristocracy is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and no body of men has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,honorable and enlightened individuals to the government of a country. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cannot, however, escape observation that in the legislation of England","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the good of the poor has been sacrificed to the advantage of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rich, and the rights of the majority to the privileges of the few. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequence is, that England, at the present day, combines the extremes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of fortune in the bosom of her society, and her perils and calamities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are almost equal to her power and her renown. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of the Government is beneficial, although the individuals who conduct it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. There is indeed a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the affections of man with his birthplace. This natural fondness is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"united to a taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traditions of the past; those who cherish it love their country as they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,love the mansions of their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contracted within its bosom; they are attached to the reminiscences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which it awakens, and they are even pleased by the state of obedience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in which they are placed. This patriotism is sometimes stimulated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by religious enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prodigious efforts. It is in itself a kind of religion; it does not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reason, but it acts from the impulse of faith and of sentiment. By","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some nations the monarch has been regarded as a personification of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country; and the fervor of patriotism being converted into the fervor of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"loyalty, they took a sympathetic pride in his conquests, and gloried in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his power. At one time, under the ancient monarchy, the French felt a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon the arbitrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasure of their king, and they were wont to say with pride, ""We are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the subjects of the most powerful king in the world.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"endeavor. It may save the State in critical circumstances, but it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whilst the manners of a people are simple and its faith unshaken, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society is steadily based upon traditional institutions whose legitimacy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has never been contested, this instinctive patriotism is wont to endure.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But there is another species of attachment to a country which is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rational than the one we have been describing. It is perhaps less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"generous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is coeval with the spread of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"grows by the exercise of civil rights, and, in the end, it is confounded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the personal interest of the citizen. A man comprehends the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence which the prosperity of his country has upon his own welfare;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute his assistance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest in the first place, and as a portion of his right in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,second.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at which the ancient customs of a people are changed, public morality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"destroyed, religious belief disturbed, and the spell of tradition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"broken, whilst the diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civil rights of the community are ill secured, or confined within very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,narrow limits. The country then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,eyes of the citizens; they no longer behold it in the soil which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabit, for that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"usages of their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as a debasing yoke; nor in religion, for of that they doubt; nor in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the laws, which do not originate in their own authority; nor in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislator, whom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"senses, they can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"features, and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a narrow egotism. They are emancipated from prejudice without having,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acknowledged the empire of reason; they are neither animated by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instinctive patriotism of monarchical subjects nor by the thinking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism of republican citizens; but they have stopped halfway between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"restore the vivacity of its earlier times, any more than a man can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,return to the innocence and the bloom of childhood; such things may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be regretted, but they cannot be renewed. The only thing, then, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remains to be done is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with public interests, since the period of disinterested patriotism is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gone by forever.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"result, the exercise of political rights should be immediately granted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to all the members of the community. But I maintain that the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powerful, and perhaps the only, means of interesting men in the welfare","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their country which we still possess is to make them partakers in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government. At the present time civic zeal seems to me to be inseparable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the exercise of political rights; and I hold that the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens will be found to augment or to decrease in Europe in proportion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as those rights are extended.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the soil which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traditions with them there; they meet each other for the first time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country can scarcely exist in their minds; but everyone takes as zealous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an interest in the affairs of his township, his county, and of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State, as if they were his own, because everyone, in his sphere, takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an active part in the government of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence exercised by the general prosperity upon their own welfare;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too rarely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,made by the people. But in America the people regards this prosperity as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the public as his private interest, and he co-operates in its success,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not so much from a sense of pride or of duty, as from what I shall","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,venture to term cupidity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans in order to discover the truth of this remark, for their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manners render it sufficiently evident. As the American participates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in all that is done in his country, he thinks himself obliged to defend","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whatever may be censured; for it is not only his country which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attacked upon these occasions, but it is himself. The consequence is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that his national pride resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,petty tricks of individual vanity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be very well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inclined to praise many of the institutions of their country, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,begs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes--a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"permission which is, however, inexorably refused. America is therefore a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"free country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are not allowed to speak freely of private individuals, or of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State, of the citizens or of the authorities, of public or of private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertakings, or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,climate and the soil; and even then Americans will be found ready to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"defend either the one or the other, as if they had been contrived by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants of the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In our times option must be made between the patriotism of all and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government of a few; for the force and activity which the first confers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"After the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that of right;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or, to speak more accurately, these two ideas are commingled in one.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The idea of right is simply that of virtue introduced into the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,world. It is the idea of right which enabled men to define anarchy and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyranny; and which taught them to remain independent without arrogance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as well as to obey without servility. The man who submits to violence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is debased by his compliance; but when he obeys the mandate of one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who possesses that right of authority which he acknowledges in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-creature, he rises in some measure above the person who delivers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the command. There are no great men without virtue, and there are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no great nations--it may almost be added that there would be no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society--without the notion of rights; for what is the condition of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mass of rational and intelligent beings who are only united together by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the bond of force?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of inculcating the notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"palpable to the senses, is to invest all the members of the community","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the peaceful exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly seen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in children, who are men without the strength and the experience of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manhood. When a child begins to move in the midst of the objects which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surround him, he is instinctively led to turn everything which he can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lay his hands upon to his own purposes; he has no notion of the property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and begins","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"becomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights in others which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he wishes to have respected in himself. The principle which the child,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derives from the possession of his toys is taught to the man by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,objects which he may call his own. In America those complaints against,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"property in general which are so frequent in Europe are never heard,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because in America there are no paupers; and as everyone has property of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his own to defend, everyone recognizes the principle upon which he holds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"classes have conceived a very high notion of political rights, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they exercise those rights; and they refrain from attacking those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other people, in order to ensure their own from attack. Whilst in Europe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American submits without a murmur to the authority of the pettiest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magistrate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclusively reserved,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever the rich are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"received, and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whatever contributes to the enjoyments in which they themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"participate. In England, where wealth has a monopoly of amusement as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"well as of power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,steal into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be wondered at,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,since care has been taken that they should have nothing to lose? *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote b: [This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the amusements of the people in public parks, gardens, museums, etc.;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the conduct of the people in these places of amusement has improved,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the same proportion.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The government of democracy brings the notion of political rights to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the level of the humblest citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,brings the notion of property within the reach of all the members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community; and I confess that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantages. I do not assert that it is easy to teach men to exercise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political rights; but I maintain that, when it is possible, the effects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which result from it are highly important; and I add that, if there ever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was a time at which such an attempt ought to be made, that time is our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own. It is clear that the influence of religious belief is shaken, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the notion of divine rights is declining; it is evident that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public morality is vitiated, and the notion of moral rights is also","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for faith, and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. If, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"midst of this general disruption, you do not succeed in connecting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the notion of rights with that of personal interest, which is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only immutable point in the human heart, what means will you have of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governing the world except by fear? When I am told that, since the laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are weak and the populace is wild, since passions are excited and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority of virtue is paralyzed, no measures must be taken to increase","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the rights of the democracy, I reply, that it is for these very reasons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that some measures of the kind must be taken; and I am persuaded that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governments are still more interested in taking them than society at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"large, because governments are liable to be destroyed and society cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perish.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,furnishes. In those States the people are invested with political rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at a time when they could scarcely be abused, for the citizens were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"few in number and simple in their manners. As they have increased, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans have not augmented the power of the democracy, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have, if I may use the expression, extended its dominions. It cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be doubted that the moment at which political rights are granted to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people that had before been without them is a very critical, though it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be a necessary one. A child may kill before he is aware of the value,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of life; and he may deprive another person of his property before he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aware that his own may be taken away from him. The lower orders, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first they are invested with political rights, stand, in relation to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those rights, in the same position as the child does to the whole of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature, and the celebrated adage may then be applied to them, Homo puer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,robustus. This truth may even be perceived in America. The States in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest are those in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they make the best use of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prodigies than the art of being free; but there is nothing more arduous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the case with despotic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions: despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"previous ills; it supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintains public order. The nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its own misery.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Liberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it cannot be denied","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that, when such a measure is possible the authority of the law is very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much augmented. This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the wisdom of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its power. There is an amazing strength in the expression of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"determination of a whole people, and when it declares itself the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imagination of those who are most inclined to contest it is overawed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its authority. The truth of this fact is very well known by parties, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they consequently strive to make out a majority whenever they can. If,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they have not the greater number of voters on their side, they assert","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are foiled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"even there, they have recourse to the body of those persons who had no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,decision.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A second reason, which is still more weighty, may be further adduced;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,obedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,professing that respect for the decrees of the legislator which it may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,soon have occasion to claim for its own. However irksome an enactment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be, the citizen of the United States complies with it, not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"because it is the work of the majority, but because it originates in his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"In the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not exist which always looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accordingly surveys it with fear and with fear and with distrust. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impossible, on the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the utmost reliance upon the legislation of their country, and that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are attached to it by a kind of parental affection.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"European scale of authority is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a position analogous to that of the poor in the Old World, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the opulent classes which frequently look upon the law with suspicion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already observed that the advantage of democracy is not, as has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been sometimes asserted, that it protects the interests of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community, but simply that it protects those of the majority. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States, where the poor rule, the rich have always some reason to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of the rich may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"produce a sullen dissatisfaction, but society is not disturbed by it;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the same reason which induces the rich to withhold their confidence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the legislative authority makes them obey its mandates; their wealth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which prevents them from making the law, prevents them from withstanding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it. Amongst civilized nations revolts are rarely excited, except by such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,persons as have nothing to lose by them; and if the laws of a democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are not always worthy of respect, at least they always obtain it; for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those who usually infringe the laws have no excuse for not complying,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the enactments they have themselves made, and by which they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose interests might be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"promoted by the infraction of them are induced, by their character and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their stations, to submit to the decisions of the legislature, whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they may be. Besides which, the people in America obeys the law not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only because it emanates from the popular authority, but because that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority may modify it in any points which may prove vexatory; a law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is observed because it is a self-imposed evil in the first place, and an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"the former all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and motionless. In the one, amelioration and progress are the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"topics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the community only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aspired to repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts itself so strenuously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"compare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are daily felt in the former, whilst so few seem to occur in the latter.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If this remark is applicable to those free countries in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarchical and aristocratic institutions subsist, it is still more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,striking with regard to democratic republics. In these States it is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only a portion of the people which is busied with the amelioration of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its social condition, but the whole community is engaged in the task;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and it is not the exigencies and the convenience of a single class for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which a provision is to be made, but the exigencies and the convenience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of all ranks of life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans enjoy; some idea may likewise be formed of the extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equality which subsists amongst them, but the political activity which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pervades the United States must be seen in order to be understood. No,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sooner do you set foot upon the American soil than you are stunned by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,simultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction of their social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wants. Everything is in motion around you; here, the people of one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,quarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a church;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"there, the election of a representative is going on; a little further","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,village quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a public school. Meetings are called for the sole purpose of declaring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the Government;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst in other assemblies the citizens salute the authorities of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day as the fathers of their country. Societies are formed which regard,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,drunkenness as the principal cause of the evils under which the State,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"labors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant example of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,temperance. *c,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,movement which originates in the lowest classes of the people and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extends successively to all the ranks of society. It is impossible to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spend more efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occupation of a citizen in the United States, and almost the only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pleasure of which an American has any idea is to take a part in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government, and to discuss the part he has taken. This feeling pervades","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most trifling habits of life; even the women frequently attend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public meetings and listen to political harangues as a recreation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,after their household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"substitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dissertation. He speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if he should chance to warm in the course of the discussion, he will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"infallibly say, ""Gentlemen,"" to the person with whom he is conversing.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves of the political privileges with which the law invests them;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it would seem that they set too high a value upon their time to spend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it on the interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and a quickset hedge. But if an American were condemned to confine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his existence; he would feel an immense void in the life which he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable. *d I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"persuaded that, if ever a despotic government is established in America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it will find it more difficult to surmount the habits which free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens to freedom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the political world influences all social intercourse. I am not sure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that upon the whole this is not the greatest advantage of democracy. And,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does than for what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it causes to be done. It is incontestable that the people frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conducts public business very ill; but it is impossible that the lower,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,orders should take a part in public business without extending the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circle of their ideas, and without quitting the ordinary routine of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their mental acquirements. The humblest individual who is called upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to co-operate in the government of society acquires a certain degree of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"self-respect; and as he possesses authority, he can command the services","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of minds much more enlightened than his own. He is canvassed by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"multitude of applicants, who seek to deceive him in a thousand different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ways, but who instruct him by their deceit. He takes a part in political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertakings which did not originate in his own conception, but which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,give him a taste for undertakings of the kind. New ameliorations are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"daily pointed out in the property which he holds in common with others,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and this gives him the desire of improving that property which is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peculiarly his own. He is perhaps neither happier nor better than those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who came before him, but he is better informed and more active. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no doubt that the democratic institutions of the United States, joined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the physical constitution of the country, are the cause (not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the direct, as is so often asserted, but the indirect cause) of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prodigious commercial activity of the inhabitants. It is not engendered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the laws, but the people learns how to promote it by the experience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derived from legislation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual performs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the duties which he undertakes much better than the government of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the community, it appears to me that they are perfectly right. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government of an individual, supposing an equality of instruction on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"either side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than that of a multitude, and it is much better qualified judiciously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to discriminate the characters of the men it employs. If any deny what I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advance, they have certainly never seen a democratic government, or have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even when local circumstances and the disposition of the people allow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic institutions to subsist, they never display a regular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and methodical system of government. Democratic liberty is far from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accomplishing all the projects it undertakes, with the skill of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adroit despotism. It frequently abandons them before they have borne,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but in the end it produces more than any absolute government, and if it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"do fewer things well, it does a greater number of things. Under its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sway the transactions of the public administration are not nearly so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,important as what is done by private exertion. Democracy does not confer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most skilful kind of government upon the people, but it produces","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that which the most skilful governments are frequently unable to awaken,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"namely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a superabundant force,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and an energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"favorable circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits. These are the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true advantages of democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,its early growth; and others are ready with their vows of adoration for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this new deity which is springing forth from chaos: but both parties are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very imperfectly acquainted with the object of their hatred or of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,chance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,We must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government is held to be. If it be your intention to confer a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elevation upon the human mind, and to teach it to regard the things of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this world with generous feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"temporal advantage, to give birth to living convictions, and to keep","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alive the spirit of honorable devotedness; if you hold it to be a good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners, to cultivate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry, of beauty, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,renown; if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act with power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon all other nations, nor unprepared for those high enterprises which,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name forever famous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in time--if you believe such to be the principal object of society, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must avoid the government of democracy, which would be a very uncertain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,guide to the end you have in view.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"activity of man to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the necessaries of life; if a clear understanding be more profitable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to man than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heroism, but to create habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than crimes and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"offences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the midst of a brilliant state of society, you are contented to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have prosperity around you; if, in short, you are of opinion that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principal object of a Government is not to confer the greatest possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"share of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but to ensure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the greatest degree of enjoyment and the least degree of misery to each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the individuals who compose it--if such be your desires, you can have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Consequences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereignty of the majority; for there is nothing in democratic States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is capable of resisting it. Most of the American Constitutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have sought to increase this natural strength of the majority by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,artificial means. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote a: We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the efforts of the legislators of the Union had been diametrically,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposed to the present tendency. The consequence has been that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Government is more independent in its sphere than that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States. But the Federal Government scarcely ever interferes in any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but external affairs; and the governments of the State are in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,governments of the States are in reality the authorities which direct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society in America.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,easily swayed by the wishes of the majority. The Americans determined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the members of the legislature should be elected by the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immediately, and for a very brief term, in order to subject them, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only to the general convictions, but even to the daily passion, of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constituents. The members of both houses are taken from the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"class in society, and are nominated in the same manner; so that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,modifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid and quite as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,irresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a legislature thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constituted that almost all the authority of the government has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,entrusted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But whilst the law increased the strength of those authorities which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of themselves were strong, it enfeebled more and more those which were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,naturally weak. It deprived the representatives of the executive of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stability and independence, and by subjecting them completely to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"caprices of the legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the nature of a democratic government might have allowed them to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,retain. In several States the judicial power was also submitted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elective discretion of the majority, and in all of them its existence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was made to depend on the pleasure of the legislative authority, since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the representatives were empowered annually to regulate the stipend of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the judges.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Custom, however, has done even more than law. A proceeding which will in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the end set all the guarantees of representative government at naught,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is becoming more and more general in the United States; it frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happens that the electors, who choose a delegate, point out a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"line of conduct to him, and impose upon him a certain number of positive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obligations which he is pledged to fulfil. With the exception of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tumult, this comes to the same thing as if the majority of the populace","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,held its deliberations in the market-place.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Several other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority in America not only preponderant, but irresistible. The moral","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of the majority is partly based upon the notion that there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is more intelligence and more wisdom in a great number of men collected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"together than in a single individual, and that the quantity of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislators is more important than their quality. The theory of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is in fact applied to the intellect of man: and human pride is thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the minority hesitate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like all other powers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and perhaps more than all other powers, the authority of the many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,requires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constraint, but its laws are not respected until they have long been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintained.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"derive from its superior intelligence, was introduced into the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States by the first settlers, and this idea, which would be sufficient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of itself to create a free nation, has now been amalgamated with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manners of the people and the minor incidents of social intercourse.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a fundamental principle of the English Constitution) that the King,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"could do no wrong; and if he did do wrong, the blame was imputed to his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advisers. This notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it enabled the subject to complain of the law without ceasing to love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and honor the lawgiver. The Americans entertain the same opinion with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,respect to the majority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the few. It will readily be perceived that the respect here professed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the rights of the majority must naturally increase or diminish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,according to the state of parties. When a nation is divided into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"several irreconcilable factions, the privilege of the majority is often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"overlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its demands.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If there existed in America a class of citizens whom the legislating,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority sought to deprive of exclusive privileges which they had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possessed for ages, and to bring down from an elevated station to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"level of the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be less ready to comply with its laws. But as the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were colonized by men holding equal rank amongst themselves, there is as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,yet no natural or permanent source of dissension between the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of its different inhabitants.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"minority can never hope to draw over the majority to their side, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they must then give up the very point which is at issue between them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, an aristocracy can never become a majority whilst it retains its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exclusive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges without ceasing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be an aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States political questions cannot be taken up in so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general and absolute a manner, and all parties are willing to recognize","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the right of the majority, because they all hope to turn those rights to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own advantage at some future time. The majority therefore in that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country exercises a prodigious actual authority, and a moral influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist which can impede,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or so much as retard its progress, or which can induce it to heed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. This state of things,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,How The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In America The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Instability Of Legislation And Administration Inherent In Democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans increase the mutability of the laws which is inherent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy by changing the legislature every year, and by investing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it with unbounded authority--The same effect is produced upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration--In America social amelioration is conducted more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,energetically but less perseveringly than in Europe.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic institutions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they all of them increase at the exact ratio of the power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority. To begin with the most evident of them all; the mutability,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the laws is an evil inherent in democratic government, because it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural to democracies to raise men to power in very rapid succession.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But this evil is more or less sensible in proportion to the authority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the means of action which the legislature possesses.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is supreme;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes with celerity, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with irresistible power, whilst they are supplied by new representatives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every year. That is to say, the circumstances which contribute most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powerfully to democratic instability, and which admit of the free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"application of caprice to every object in the State, are here in full","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"operation. In conformity with this principle, America is, at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"day, the country in the world where laws last the shortest time. Almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the American constitutions have been amended within the course of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thirty years: there is therefore not a single American State which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not modified the principles of its legislation in that lapse of time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As for the laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different States of the Union suffices to convince one that in America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the activity of the legislator never slackens. Not that the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy is naturally less stable than any other, but that it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,allowed to follow its capricious propensities in the formation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Massachusetts alone, from the year 1780 to the present time, already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fill three stout volumes; and it must not be forgotten that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collection to which I allude was published in 1823, when many old laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which had fallen into disuse were omitted. The State of Massachusetts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is not more populous than a department of France, may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"considered as the most stable, the most consistent, and the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sagacious in its undertakings of the whole Union.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manner in which its decisions are executed in the United States, has not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only the effect of rendering the law unstable, but it exercises the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence upon the execution of the law and the conduct of the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,administration. As the majority is the only power which it is important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to court, all its projects are taken up with the greatest ardor, but no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sooner is its attention distracted than all this ardor ceases; whilst in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the free States of Europe the administration is at once independent and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"secure, so that the projects of the legislature are put into execution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,although its immediate attention may be directed to other objects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,activity than elsewhere; in Europe the same ends are promoted by much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less social effort, more continuously applied.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Some years ago several pious individuals undertook to ameliorate the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition of the prisons. The public was excited by the statements,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals became a very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"popular undertaking. New prisons were built, and for the first time the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,idea of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of prison discipline. But this happy alteration, in which the public had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions of the citizens had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a moment. Whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the pleasure of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority that they should be terminated with all possible celerity), the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"old prisons existed, which still contained a great number of offenders.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These jails became more unwholesome and more corrupt in proportion as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the new establishments were beautified and improved, forming a contrast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which may readily be understood. The majority was so eagerly employed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in founding the new prisons that those which already existed were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to a novel object,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the care which had hitherto been bestowed upon the others ceased. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"salutary regulations of discipline were first relaxed, and afterwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,broken; so that in the immediate neighborhood of a prison which bore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"witness to the mild and enlightened spirit of our time, dungeons might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be met with which reminded the visitor of the barbarity of the Middle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Am I then, in contradiction with myself?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A general law--which bears the name of Justice--has been made and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that people, but by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a majority of mankind. The rights of every people are consequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confined within the limits of what is just. A nation may be considered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the light of a jury which is empowered to represent society at large,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and to apply the great and general law of justice. Ought such a jury,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which represents society, to have more power than the society in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws it applies originate?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the sovereignty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has been asserted that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequently, full power may fearlessly be given to the majority by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it is represented. But this language is that of a slave.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of another","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"being, which is styled a minority. If it be admitted that a man,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possessing absolute power, may misuse that power by wronging his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adversaries, why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Men are not apt to change their characters by agglomeration; nor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consciousness of their strength. *c And for these reasons I can never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,willingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority which I should refuse to any one of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote c: No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,another people; but parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a greater one, and they are aliens to each other: if, therefore, it be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"admitted that a nation can act tyrannically towards another nation, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be denied that a party may do the same towards another party.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I do not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same government, so as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to oppose them to one another. The form of government which is usually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,termed mixed has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,speaking there is no such thing as a mixed government (with the meaning,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"usually given to that word), because in all communities some one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principle of action may be discovered which preponderates over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others. England in the last century, which has been more especially","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cited as an example of this form of Government, was in point of fact","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an essentially aristocratic State, although it comprised very powerful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elements of democracy; for the laws and customs of the country were such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the direction of public affairs to its own will. The error arose from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,too much attention being paid to the actual struggle which was going,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on between the nobles and the people, without considering the probable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"issue of the contest, which was in reality the important point. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a community really has a mixed government, that is to say, when it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equally divided between two adverse principles, it must either pass","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,through a revolution or fall into complete dissolution.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to predominate over the others; but I think that liberty is endangered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when this power is checked by no obstacles which may retard its course,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and force it to moderate its own vehemence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"reverential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consent to admit its uncontrolled and all-predominant authority. When I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,see that the right and the means of absolute command are conferred on a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a democracy, a monarchy or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the despotism of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year 1812.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,an entire control over the law when it is made and when it is executed;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and as it possesses an equal authority over those who are in power and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the community at large, it considers public officers as its passive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agents, and readily confides the task of serving its designs to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vigilance. The details of their office and the privileges which they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats them as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a master does his servants when they are always at work in his sight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and he has the power of directing or reprimanding them at every instant.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In general the American functionaries are far more independent than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,French civil officers within the sphere which is prescribed to them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Sometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular authority to exceed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those bounds; and as they are protected by the opinion, and backed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the co-operation, of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their power as astonish a European. By this means habits are formed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the heart of a free country which may some day prove fatal to its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Power Exercised By The Majority In America Upon Opinion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided a question,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all discussion ceases--Reason of this--Moral power exercised by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority upon opinion--Democratic republics have deprived despotism of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its physical instruments--Their despotism sways the minds of men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States that we clearly perceive how far the power of the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,surpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted in Europe.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Intellectual principles exercise an influence which is so invisible, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"often so inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression. At the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present time the most absolute monarchs in Europe are unable to prevent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"certain notions, which are opposed to their authority, from circulating","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in secret throughout their dominions, and even in their courts. Such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is not the case in America; as long as the majority is still undecided,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision is irrevocably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pronounced, a submissive silence is observed, and the friends, as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as the opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The reason of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"combine all the powers of society in his own hands, and to conquer all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposition with the energy of a majority which is invested with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right of making and of executing the laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the subject without subduing his private will; but the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possesses a power which is physical and moral at the same time; it acts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon the will as well as upon the actions of men, and it represses not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only all contest, but all controversy. I know no country in which there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is so little true independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America. In any constitutional state in Europe every sort of religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and political theory may be advocated and propagated abroad; for there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is no country in Europe so subdued by any single authority as not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contain citizens who are ready to protect the man who raises his voice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the cause of truth from the consequences of his hardihood. If he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unfortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is upon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may find a shelter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"behind the authority of the throne, if he require one. The aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"part of society supports him in some countries, and the democracy in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others. But in a nation where democratic institutions exist, organized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like those of the United States, there is but one sole authority, one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"single element of strength and of success, with nothing beyond it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of opinion: within these barriers an author may write whatever he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond them. Not that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the slights and persecutions of daily obloquy. His political career is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"closed forever, since he has offended the only authority which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"able to promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opinions he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imagined that he held them in common with many others; but no sooner has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he declared them openly than he is loudly censured by his overbearing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opponents, whilst those who think without having the courage to speak,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like him, abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"daily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into silence, as if he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was tormented by remorse for having spoken the truth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Fetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,employed; but the civilization of our age has refined the arts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despotism which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently perfected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,before. The excesses of monarchical power had devised a variety of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,physical means of oppression: the democratic republics of the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,day have rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind as that will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of an individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despot the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul, and the soul","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,escaped the blows which were directed against it and rose superior to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the attempt; but such is not the course adopted by tyranny in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republics; there the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign can no longer say, ""You shall think as I do on pain of death;""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but he says, ""You are free to think differently from me, and to retain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"your life, your property, and all that you possess; but if such be your","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"determination, you are henceforth an alien among your people. You may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retain your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"never be chosen by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they will affect to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. You will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remain among men, but you will be deprived of the rights of mankind.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Your fellow-creatures will shun you like an impure being, and those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are most persuaded of your innocence will abandon you too, lest they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,should be shunned in their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"life, but it is an existence in comparably worse than death.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Monarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"beware lest democratic republics should restore oppression, and should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"render it less odious and less degrading in the eyes of the many, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,making it still more onerous to the few.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Works have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expressly intended to censure the vices and deride the follies of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,times; Labruyere inhabited the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"chapter upon the Great, and Moliere criticised the courtiers in the very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pieces which were acted before the Court. But the ruling power in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States is not to be made game of; the smallest reproach irritates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its sensibility, and the slightest joke which has any foundation in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,truth renders it indignant; from the style of its language to the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"solid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape from this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. The majority lives in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perpetual practice of self-applause, and there are certain truths which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Americans can only learn from strangers or from experience.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is very simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America. The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,removes the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be met with in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Attempts have been made by some governments to protect the morality of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"punished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,because the majority of the community is decent and orderly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are unquestionable, and I am simply discussing the nature of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power itself. This irresistible authority is a constant fact, and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,many--Proofs of this spirit in the United States--Why there is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism in the people than in those who govern in its name.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perceptible in political society, but they already begin to exercise an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unfavorable influence upon the national character of the Americans. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,am inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,characters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority in the United States. When the American Revolution broke out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they arose in great numbers, for public opinion then served, not to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyrannize over, but to direct the exertions of individuals. Those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,celebrated men took a full part in the general agitation of mind common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at that period, and they attained a high degree of personal fame, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was reflected back upon the nation, but which was by no means borrowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In absolute governments the great nobles who are nearest to the throne,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"flatter the passions of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his caprices. But the mass of the nation does not degrade itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by servitude: it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. Some nations have been known to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sacrifice their own desires to those of the sovereign with pleasure and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with pride, thus exhibiting a sort of independence in the very act of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"submission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not degraded.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There is a great difference between doing what one does not approve and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,feigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weak person, the other befits the temper of a lackey.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In free countries, where everyone is more or less called upon to give","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his opinion in the affairs of state; in democratic republics, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public life is incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign authority is accessible on every side, and where its attention","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"can almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons are to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be met with who speculate upon its foibles and live at the cost of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions than in absolute monarchies. Not because men are naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"worse in these States than elsewhere, but the temptation is stronger,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of easier access at the same time. The result is a far more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extensive debasement of the characters of citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Democratic republics extend the practice of currying favor with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many, and they introduce it into a greater number of classes at once:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this is one of the most serious reproaches that can be addressed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them. In democratic States organized on the principles of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republics, this is more especially the case, where the authority of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority is so absolute and so irresistible that a man must give up his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights as a citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a human being, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,te intends to stray from the track which it lays down.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States I found very few men who displayed any of that manly candor and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that masculine independence of opinion which frequently distinguished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Americans in former times, and which constitutes the leading feature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in distinguished characters, wheresoever they may be found. It seems, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first sight, as if all the minds of the Americans were formed upon one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"model, so accurately do they correspond in their manner of judging. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with Americans who dissent from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these rigorous formularies; with men who deplore the defects of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws, the mutability and the ignorance of democracy; who even go so far","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as to observe the evil tendencies which impair the national character,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and to point out such remedies as it might be possible to apply; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no one is there to hear these things besides yourself, and you, to whom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these secret reflections are confided, are a stranger and a bird of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passage. They are very ready to communicate truths which are useless to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"you, but they continue to hold a different language in public.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"things: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"voices to condemn me; and in the second place, that very many of them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will acquit me at the bottom of their conscience.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which may be found among the people, but never among the leaders of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people. This may be explained by analogy; despotism debases the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppressed much more than the oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has often great virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"true that the American courtiers do not say ""Sire,"" or ""Your Majesty""--a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinction without a difference. They are forever talking of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural intelligence of the populace they serve; they do not debate the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question as to which of the virtues of their master is pre-eminently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"worthy of admiration, for they assure him that he possesses all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"virtues under heaven without having acquired them, or without caring to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acquire them; they do not give him their daughters and their wives to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines, but, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sacrificing their opinions, they prostitute themselves. Moralists and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,philosophers in America are not obliged to conceal their opinions under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon a harsh truth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they say, ""We are aware that the people which we are addressing is too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,superior to all the weaknesses of human nature to lose the command of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its temper for an instant; and we should not hold this language if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we were not speaking to men whom their virtues and their intelligence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"render more worthy of freedom than all the rest of the world."" It would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have been impossible for the sycophants of Louis XIV to flatter more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dexterously. For my part, I am persuaded that in all governments,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whatever their nature may be, servility will cower to force, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adulation will cling to power. The only means of preventing men from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,degrading themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited authority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is the surest method of debasing them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Greatest Dangers Of The American Republics Proceed From The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Unlimited Power Of The Majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Democratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their power, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not by impotence--The Governments of the American republics are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more centralized and more energetic than those of the monarchies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europe--Dangers resulting from this--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon this point.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Governments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the former case their power escapes from them; it is wrested from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"grasp in the latter. Many observers, who have witnessed the anarchy of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic States, have imagined that the government of those States was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally weak and impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are begun between parties, the government loses its control over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society. But I do not think that a democratic power is naturally without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"force or without resources: say, rather, that it is almost always by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the abuse of its force and the misemployment of its resources that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic government fails. Anarchy is almost always produced by its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a thing with its duration. In democratic republics, the power which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,directs *e society is not stable; for it often changes hands and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assumes a new direction. But whichever way it turns, its force is almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,irresistible. The Governments of the American republics appear to me to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be as much centralized as those of the absolute monarchies of Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and more energetic than they are. I do not, therefore, imagine that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will perish from weakness. *f,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"some future time urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have recourse to physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will have been brought about by despotism.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Mr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the ""Federalist,"" No. 51.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,secured against the violence of the stronger: and as in the latter state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,condition to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as themselves, so in the former state will the more powerful factions be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gradually induced by a like motive to wish for a government which will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"little doubted that, if the State of Rhode Island was separated from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of right under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,popular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities, that some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Chapter Summary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The national majority does not pretend to conduct all business--Is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliged to employ the town and county magistrates to execute its supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decisions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a centralized government and a centralized administration. The former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown there. If the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,directing power of the American communities had both these instruments,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of government at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commands to the right of commanding; if, after having established the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general principles of government, it descended to the details of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"business; and if, having regulated the great interests of the country,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it could penetrate into the privacy of individual interests, freedom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would soon be banished from the New World.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tastes and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perfect instruments of tyranny. In the American republics the activity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the central Government has never as yet been extended beyond a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,limited number of objects sufficiently prominent to call forth its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attention. The secondary affairs of society have never been regulated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by its authority, and nothing has hitherto betrayed its desire of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interfering in them. The majority is become more and more absolute, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it has not increased the prerogatives of the central government; those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great prerogatives have been confined to a certain sphere; and although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point, it cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be said to extend to all. However the predominant party in the nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be carried away by its passions, however ardent it may be in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pursuit of its projects, it cannot oblige all the citizens to comply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with its desires in the same manner and at the same time throughout the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country. When the central Government which represents that majority has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"issued a decree, it must entrust the execution of its will to agents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"over whom it frequently has no control, and whom it cannot perpetually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"direct. The townships, municipal bodies, and counties may therefore be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"looked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or part the tide of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"popular excitement. If an oppressive law were passed, the liberties of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people would still be protected by the means by which that law would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details and (as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative tyranny.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nor does the people entertain that full consciousness of its authority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which would prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extent of its natural powers, but it is unacquainted with the increased","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,resources which the art of government might furnish.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This point deserves attention, for if a democratic republic similar to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of the United States were ever founded in a country where the power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a single individual had previously subsisted, and the effects of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the people, I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insufferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarchical States of Europe, or indeed than any which could be found on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we perceive that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the authority they have entrusted to members of the legal profession,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the influence which these individuals exercise in the Government, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This effect seems to me to result from a general cause which it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"useful to investigate, since it may produce analogous consequences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elsewhere.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the vicissitudes of political society in Europe during the last five,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hundred years. At one time they have been the instruments of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who were invested with political authority, and at another they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,succeeded in converting political authorities into their instrument. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Middle Ages they afforded a powerful support to the Crown, and since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that period they have exerted themselves to the utmost to limit the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,royal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close alliance with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most dangerous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enemies of that class. It is my object to inquire whether, under all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these circumstances, the members of the legal profession have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,swayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impelled by principles which are inherent in their pursuits, and which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will always recur in history. I am incited to this investigation by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reflecting that this particular class of men will most likely play a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are giving birth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Men who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits derive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from those occupations certain habits of order, a taste for formalities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and a kind of instinctive regard for the regular connection of ideas,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which naturally render them very hostile to the revolutionary spirit and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the unreflecting passions of the multitude.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them a separate station in society, and they constitute a sort of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,privileged body in the scale of intelligence. This notion of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,superiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"profession: they are the masters of a science which is necessary, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is not very generally known; they serve as arbiters between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions of parties in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,litigation to their purpose inspires them with a certain contempt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the judgment of the multitude. To this it may be added that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally constitute a body, not by any previous understanding, or by an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agreement which directs them to a common end; but the analogy of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,studies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect their minds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"together, as much as a common interest could combine their endeavors.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently be discovered in the characters of men in the profession of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the law. They participate in the same instinctive love of order and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people. I do not mean to say that the natural propensities of lawyers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other men, are governed by their private interests and the advantages of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the moment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevented from holding that rank in the political world which they enjoy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in private life, we may rest assured that they will be the foremost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agents of revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which induces them to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or whether","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it belongs to some lasting purpose which they entertain. It is true that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow of the French monarchy in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus because they had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"studied the laws, or because they were prohibited from co-operating in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the work of legislation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Five hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in its name; at the present time the aristocracy supports the throne,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and defends the royal prerogative. But aristocracy has, notwithstanding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this, its peculiar instincts and propensities. We must be careful not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to confound isolated members of a body with the body itself. In all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"free governments, of whatsoever form they may be, members of the legal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,profession will be found at the head of all parties. The same remark,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is also applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,convulsions which have agitated the world have been directed by nobles.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has always more talents and more passions to content and to employ than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it can find places; so that a considerable number of individuals are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,usually to be met with who are inclined to attack those very privileges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they find it impossible to turn to their own account.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at all times the friends of order and the opponents of innovation, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,merely that most of them usually are so. In a community in which lawyers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conservative and anti-democratic. When an aristocracy excludes the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"leaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are the more formidable to its security as they are independent of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nobility by their industrious pursuits; and they feel themselves to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its equal in point of intelligence, although they enjoy less opulence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"readily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single order of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,family interests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be able to convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instruments of his authority. There is a far greater affinity between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this class of individuals and the executive power than there is between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them and the people; just as there is a greater natural affinity between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the nobles and the monarch than between the nobles and the people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,although the higher orders of society have occasionally resisted the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower classes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Lawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the best security of public order is authority. It must not be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forgotten that, if they prize the free institutions of their country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"much, they nevertheless value the legality of those institutions far","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more: they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provided that the legislature take upon itself to deprive men of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence, they are not dissatisfied.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"encroaching democracy, should endeavor to impair the judicial authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in his dominions, and to diminish the political influence of lawyers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would commit a great mistake. He would let slip the substance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of authority to grasp at the shadow. He would act more wisely in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introducing men connected with the law into the government; and if he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some marks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of violence, that power would most likely assume the external features","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of justice and of legality in their hands.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The government of democracy is favorable to the political power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince are excluded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the government, they are sure to occupy the highest stations, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and sagacity, beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes to combine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they are naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,brought into contact with the people by their interests. They like the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government of democracy, without participating in its propensities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and without imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, from it and over it. The people in democratic states does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is well known","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that they are interested in serving the popular cause; and it listens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to them without irritation, because it does not attribute to them any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sinister designs. The object of lawyers is not, indeed, to overthrow the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor to give it an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by means which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,looked upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,classes of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I am,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the character,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of that body of men; but without this admixture of lawyer-like,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sobriety with the democratic principle, I question whether democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions could long be maintained, and I cannot believe that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republic could subsist at the present time if the influence of lawyers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in public business did not increase in proportion to the power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"profession, is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,England than in any other country. This proceeds not only from the legal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"studies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the legislation, and the position which those persons occupy in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two countries. The English and the Americans have retained the law of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"precedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and the decisions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their forefathers. In the mind of an English or American lawyer a taste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and a reverence for what is old is almost always united to a love of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regular and lawful proceedings.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,profession and upon the general course of society. The English and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American lawyers investigate what has been done; the French advocate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inquires what should have been done; the former produce precedents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the latter reasons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an English dr an American lawyer quotes the opinions of others, and how","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,little he alludes to his own; whilst the reverse occurs in France. There,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most trifling litigation is never conducted without the introduction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel employed; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fundamental principles of law are discussed in order to obtain a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perch of land by the decision of the court. This abnegation of his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his forefathers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which are common to the English and American lawyer, this subjection of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thought which he is obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,habits and more sluggish inclinations in England and America than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,France.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"read by every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,indispensable want of legal assistance which is felt in England and in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States, and the high opinion which is generally entertained","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the ability of the legal profession, tend to separate it more and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more from the people, and to place it in a distinct class. The French","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Egypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less an influence upon their habits and their opinions. The English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aristocracy, which has taken care to attract to its sphere whatever is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at all analogous to itself, has conferred a high degree of importance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and of authority upon the members of the legal profession. In English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society lawyers do not occupy the first rank, but they are contented","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the station assigned to them; they constitute, as it were, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"younger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their elder brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The English lawyers consequently mingle the taste and the ideas of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocratic circles in which they move with the aristocratic interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their profession.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,And indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most distinctly to be met with in England: there laws are esteemed not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so much because they are good as because they are old; and if it be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"necessary to modify them in any respect, or to adapt them the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changes which time operates in society, recourse is had to the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inconceivable contrivances in order to uphold the traditionary fabric,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and to maintain that nothing has been done which does not square with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the intentions and complete the labors of former generations. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very individuals who conduct these changes disclaim all intention of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"innovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than plead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,guilty to so great a crime. This spirit appertains more especially to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they treat, and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inclined to infringe the rules of common sense and of humanity rather,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than to swerve one title from the law. The English legislation may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"compared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most various shoots, with the hope that, although their fruits may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"differ, their foliage at least will be confounded with the venerable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,trunk which supports them all.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America there are no nobles or men of letters, and the people is apt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"class, and the most cultivated circle of society. They have therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their natural taste for public order. If I were asked where I place the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation that it is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"composed of the rich, who are united together by no common tie, but that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shall we be persuaded that the lawyers as a body form the most powerful,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if not the only, counterpoise to the democratic element. In that country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we perceive how eminently the legal profession is qualified by its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the vices which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inherent in popular government. When the American people is intoxicated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of its ideas, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of its legal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"counsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic instincts, their superstitious attachment to what is antique","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"profession is enabled to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who, independently of the taste for regularity and order which he has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stability from his own inalienable functions. His legal attainments have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,already raised him to a distinguished rank amongst his fellow-citizens;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his political power completes the distinction of his station, and gives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,him the inclinations natural to privileged classes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Armed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional, *a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American magistrate perpetually interferes in political affairs. He,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cannot force the people to make laws, but at least he can oblige it not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to disobey its own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principles. I am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power exists in the United States, and by most of the constitutions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the several States the Government can, upon the demand of the two houses","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the legislature, remove the judges from their station. By some other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict that these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal consequences,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and that it will be found out at some future period that the attack,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is made upon the judicial power has affected the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republic itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote a: See chapter VI. on the ""Judicial Power in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been speaking has been confined, in the United States, to the courts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,justice; it extends far beyond them. As the lawyers constitute the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enlightened class which the people does not mistrust, they are naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,called upon to occupy most of the public stations. They fill the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislative assemblies, and they conduct the administration; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently exercise a powerful influence upon the formation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"law, and upon its execution. The lawyers are, however, obliged to yield","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the current of public opinion, which is too strong for them to resist","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it, but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct would be if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they were free to act as they chose. The Americans, who have made such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"copious innovations in their political legislation, have introduced very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with great difficulty,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,although those laws are frequently repugnant to their social condition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The reason of this is, that in matters of civil law the majority is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obliged to defer to the authority of the legal profession, and that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American lawyers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,own choice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"things, to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States against the stationary propensities of legal men, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prejudices in favor of existing institutions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,beyond the limits I have just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the United States which does not become, sooner or later, a subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and even the language, usual in judicial proceedings in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"daily controversies. As most public men are, or have been, legal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"practitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,profession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habitude to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"walls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"classes, so that the whole people contracts the habits and the tastes of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the magistrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the exigencies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the time, and accommodates itself to all the movements of the social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"body; but this party extends over the whole community, and it penetrates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"into all classes of society; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it finally fashions it to suit its purposes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Since I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"justice in the United States, I will not pass over this point without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adverting to the institution of the jury. Trial by jury may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"considered in two separate points of view, as a judicial and as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political institution. If it entered into my present purpose to inquire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,how far trial by jury (more especially in civil cases) contributes to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insure the best administration of justice, I admit that its utility","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,might be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"merely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it is not an easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,task to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized community when the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mutual relations of men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,assumed the enlightened and intellectual character of the age. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote b: The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institution, and the appreciation of its effects in the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"together with the advantages the Americans have derived from it, would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suffice to form a book, and a book upon a very useful and curious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subject. The State of Louisiana would in particular afford the curious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"phenomenon of a French and English legislation, as well as a French and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"English population, which are gradually combining with each other. See","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ""Digeste des Lois de la Louisiane,"" in two volumes; and the ""Traite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sur les Regles des Actions civiles,"" printed in French and English at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New Orleans in 1830.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"My present object is to consider the jury as a political institution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and any other course would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"considered as a judicial institution, I shall here say but very few","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,words. When the English adopted trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people; they are become, in course of time, one of the most enlightened","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations of the earth; and their attachment to this institution seems,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to have increased with their increasing cultivation. They soon spread,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,beyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the habitable globe;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some have formed colonies, others independent states; the mother-country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has maintained its monarchical constitution; many of its offspring have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,founded powerful republics; but wherever the English have been they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"boasted of the privilege of trial by jury. *c They have established it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or hastened to re-establish it, in all their settlements. A judicial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institution which obtains the suffrages of a great people for so long,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a series of ages, which is zealously renewed at every epoch of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, in all the climates of the earth and under every form of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human government, cannot be contrary to the spirit of justice. *d","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote c: All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this head. Mr. Story, judge of the Supreme Court of the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of trial by jury in civil cases:--""The inestimable privilege of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,trial by jury in civil cases--a privilege scarcely inferior to that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"political and civil liberty. . . ."" (Story, book iii., chap. xxxviii.)]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: If it were our province to point out the utility of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"jury as a judicial institution in this place, much might be said, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the following arguments might be brought forward amongst others:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,By introducing the jury into the business of the courts you are enabled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to diminish the number of judges, which is a very great advantage. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judges are very numerous, death is perpetually thinning the ranks of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are naturally made dependent upon the will of the majority, or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual who fills up the vacant appointments; the officers of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,court then rise like the officers of an army. This state of things is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entirely contrary to the sound administration of justice, and to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intentions of the legislator. The office of a judge is made inalienable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in order that he may remain independent: but of what advantage is it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it of his own accord? When judges are very numerous many of them must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"necessarily be incapable of performing their important duties, for a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great magistrate is a man of no common powers; and I am inclined to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,believe that a half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for attaining those objects which it is the purpose of courts of justice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to accomplish. For my own part, I had rather submit the decision of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,case to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful judge than to judges a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,majority of whom are imperfectly acquainted with jurisprudence and with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a mere judicial institution is to confine our attention to a very narrow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,view of it; for however great its influence may be upon the decisions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the law courts, that influence is very subordinate to the powerful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,effects which it produces on the destinies of the community at large.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The jury is above all a political institution, and it must be regarded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in this light in order to be duly appreciated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"By the jury I mean a certain number of citizens chosen indiscriminately,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and invested with a temporary right of judging. Trial by jury, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"applied to the repression of crime, appears to me to introduce an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,eminently republican element into the government upon the following,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,grounds:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the class of society from which the jurors are selected; but it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"always preserves its republican character, inasmuch as it places the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the governed, instead of leaving it under the authority of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government. Force is never more than a transient element of success; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,after force comes the notion of right. A government which should only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle would very soon be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,destroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to be found in penal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislation, and if that sanction be wanting the law will sooner or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,later lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of the law is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore the real master of society. Now the institution of the jury,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"raises the people itself, or at least a class of citizens, to the bench","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of judicial authority. The institution of the jury consequently invests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people, or that class of citizens, with the direction of society. *e","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote e: An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does unquestionably invest the people with a general control over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"actions of citizens, but it does not furnish means of exercising this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"control in all cases, or with an absolute authority. When an absolute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monarch has the right of trying offences by his representatives, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fate of the prisoner is, as it were, decided beforehand. But even if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people were predisposed to convict, the composition and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,non-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances favorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the protection of innocence.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the nation; *f the aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,punishes all infractions of the laws; everything is established upon a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consistent footing, and England may with truth be said to constitute an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocratic republic. In the United States the same system is applied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the whole people. Every American citizen is qualified to be an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g The system of the jury,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as it is understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as universal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"suffrage. These institutions are two instruments of equal power, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"chosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor sent to prison jurors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to be returned by his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agents.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote f: [This may be true to some extent of special juries, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not of common juries. The author seems not to have been aware that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,qualifications of jurors in England vary exceedingly.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote g: See Appendix, Q.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"However clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"universal assent, and in France, at least, the institution of trial by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,jury is still very imperfectly understood. If the question arises as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the intelligence and knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if the jury was merely a judicial institution. This appears to me to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be the least part of the subject. The jury is pre-eminently a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected, or it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must be adapted to the laws by which that sovereignty is established.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws is entrusted, as the Houses of Parliament constitute that part","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"governed with consistency and uniformity, the list of citizens qualified","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list of electors.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This I hold to be the point of view most worthy of the attention of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislator, and all that remains is merely accessory.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institution that I still consider it in this light when it is applied in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civil causes. Laws are always unstable unless they are founded upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manners of a nation; manners are the only durable and resisting power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a people. When the jury is reserved for criminal offences, the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only witnesses its occasional action in certain particular cases; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ordinary course of life goes on without its interference, and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obtaining justice. This is true a fortiori when the jury is only applied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to certain criminal causes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"causes, its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests of the community; everyone co-operates in its work: it thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"penetrates into all the usages of life, it fashions the human mind to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the idea of justice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in danger, but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defies the aggressions of time and of man. If it had been as easy to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remove the jury from the manners as from the laws of England, it would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have perished under Henry VIII, and Elizabeth, and the civil jury did in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reality, at that period, save the liberties of the country. In whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manner the jury be applied, it cannot fail to exercise a powerful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence upon the national character; but this influence is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"jury, and more especially the jury in civil cases, serves to communicate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,free institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judged, and with the notion of right. If these two elements be removed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the love of independence is reduced to a mere destructive passion. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"teaches men to practice equity, every man learns to judge his neighbor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as he would himself be judged; and this is especially true of the jury,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in civil causes, for, whilst the number of persons who have reason to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"apprehend a criminal prosecution is small, every one is liable to have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a civil action brought against him. The jury teaches every man not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recoil before the responsibility of his own actions, and impresses him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with that manly confidence without which political virtue cannot exist.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy, it makes them all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feel the duties which they are bound to discharge towards society, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the part which they take in the Government. By obliging men to turn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their attention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,off that individual egotism which is the rust of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increase the natural intelligence of a people, and this is, in my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinion, its greatest advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"judge, and even by the passions of the parties. I think that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,practical intelligence and political good sense of the Americans are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civil causes. I do not know whether the jury is useful to those who are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in litigation; but I am certain it is highly beneficial to those who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decide the litigation; and I look upon it as one of the most efficacious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means for the education of the people which society can employ.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"What I have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,am now about to make is peculiar to the Americans and to democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peoples. I have already observed that in democracies the members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legal profession and the magistrates constitute the only aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,body which can check the irregularities of the people. This aristocracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is invested with no physical power, but it exercises its conservative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence upon the minds of men, and the most abundant source of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority is the institution of the civil jury. In criminal causes, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society is armed against a single individual, the jury is apt to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"look upon the judge as the passive instrument of social power, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely founded upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate; upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this ground the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is not the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,case in civil causes; then the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the conflicting passions of the parties. The jurors look up to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him with confidence and listen to him with respect, for in this instance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their intelligence is completely under the control of his learning. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is the judge who sums up the various arguments with which their memory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has been wearied out, and who guides them through the devious course of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the proceedings; he points their attention to the exact question of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts the answer to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question of law into their mouths. His influence upon their verdict is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost unlimited.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I reply,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that in these proceedings, whenever the question to be solved is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a mere question of fact, the jury has only the semblance of a judicial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"body. The jury sanctions the decision of the judge, they by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority of society which they represent, and he by that of reason and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of law. *h,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote h: See Appendix, R.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon criminal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,trials which the French judges have never possessed. The reason of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this difference may easily be discovered; the English and American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"magistrates establish their authority in civil causes, and only transfer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it afterwards to tribunals of another kind, where that authority was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not acquired. In some cases (and they are frequently the most important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ones) the American judges have the right of deciding causes alone. *i,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Upon these occasions they are accidentally placed in the position which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the French judges habitually occupy, but they are invested with far more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power than the latter; they are still surrounded by the reminiscence of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the jury, and their judgment has almost as much authority as the voice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the community at large, represented by that institution. Their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence extends beyond the limits of the courts; in the recreations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private life as well as in the turmoil of public business, abroad and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the legislative assemblies, the American judge is constantly surrounded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by men who are accustomed to regard his intelligence as superior to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their own, and after having exercised his power in the decision","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of causes, he continues to influence the habits of thought and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,characters of the individuals who took a part in his judgment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote i: The Federal judges decide upon their own authority almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the questions most important to the country.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in reality consolidate its power, and in no country are the judges so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powerful as there, where the people partakes their privileges. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,magistrates imbue all classes of society with the spirit of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"profession. Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people rule, is also the most efficacious means of teaching it to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rule well.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the principal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,object of this book has been to account for the fact of its existence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Several of the causes which contribute to maintain the institutions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America have been involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as I was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"borne along by my subject. Others I have been unable to discuss, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those on which I have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the former parts of this work. I think, therefore, that before I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better than collect within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a small compass the reasons which best explain the present. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retrospective chapter I shall be succinct, for I shall take care to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remind the reader very summarily of what he already knows; and I shall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only select the most prominent of those facts which I have not yet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pointed out.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republic in the United States are reducible to three heads:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,II. The laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Accidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The Maintenance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Of The Democratic Republic In The United States The Union has no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,neighbors--No metropolis--The Americans have had the chances of birth in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their favor--America an empty country--How this circumstance contributes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in America--How,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American wilds are peopled--Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of the solitudes of the New World--Influence of physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity upon the political opinions of the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,facilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. Some of these peculiarities are known, the others may easily be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pointed out; but I shall confine myself to the most prominent amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wars, or financial crises, or inroads, or conquest to dread; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"require neither great taxes, nor great armies, nor great generals; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they have nothing to fear from a scourge which is more formidable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"republics than all these evils combined, namely, military glory. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is impossible to deny the inconceivable influence which military,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"glory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson, whom the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans have twice elected to the head of their Government, is a man","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a violent temper and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whole course of his career ever proved that he is qualified to govern a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"free people, and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union has always been opposed to him. But he was raised to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Presidency, and has been maintained in that lofty station, solely by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, however, a very ordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"achievement, and which could only be remembered in a country where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,battles are rare. Now the people which is thus carried away by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"illusions of glory is unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the peoples of the earth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America has no great capital *a city, whose influence is directly or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indirectly felt over the whole extent of the country, which I hold to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one of the first causes of the maintenance of republican institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the United States. In cities men cannot be prevented from concerting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"together, and from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sudden and passionate resolutions. Cities may be looked upon as large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their populace","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,executes its own wishes without their intervention.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote a: The United States have no metropolis, but they already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contain several very large cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants and New York 202,000 in the year 1830. The lower orders","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which inhabit these cities constitute a rabble even more formidable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than the populace of European towns. They consist of freed blacks in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first place, who are condemned by the laws and by public opinion to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a hereditary state of misery and degradation. They also contain a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,multitude of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,World by their misfortunes or their misconduct; and these men inoculate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States with all our vices, without bringing with them any of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those interests which counteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a country where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the passions which agitate the community to their own advantage; thus,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,within the last few months serious riots have broken out in Philadelphia,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and in New York. Disturbances of this kind are unknown in the rest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the country, which is nowise alarmed by them, because the population of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the cities has hitherto exercised neither power nor influence over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rural districts. Nevertheless, I look upon the size of certain American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cities, and especially on the nature of their population, as a real","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,danger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the New World; and I venture to predict that they will perish from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this circumstance unless the government succeeds in creating an armed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"force, which, whilst it remains under the control of the majority of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation, will be independent of the town population, and able to repress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its excesses.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870, to 942,292,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and that of Philadelphia to 674,022. Brooklyn, which may be said to form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"part of New York city, has a population of 396,099, in addition to that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of New York. The frequent disturbances in the great cities of America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the excessive corruption of their local governments--over which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there is no effectual control--are amongst the greatest evils and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangers of the country.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,To subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to place the destiny of the empire in the hands of a portion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"community, which may be reprobated as unjust, but to place it in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be avoided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as dangerous. The preponderance of capital cities is therefore a serious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"blow upon the representative system, and it exposes modern republics to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same defect as the republics of antiquity, which all perished from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not having been acquainted with that form of government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic republic of the United States. But I discern two principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances amongst these favorable elements, which I hasten to point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,out. I have already observed that the origin of the American settlements,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause to which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present prosperity of the United States may be attributed. The Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had the chances of birth in their favor, and their forefathers imported","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that equality of conditions into the country whence the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republic has very naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they did;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for besides this republican condition of society, the early settler","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which contribute most to the success of a republican form of government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When I reflect upon the consequences of this primary circumstance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,methinks I see the destiny of America embodied in the first Puritan who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"landed on those shores, just as the human race was represented by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States is the nature,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the territory which the American inhabit. Their ancestors gave them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the love of equality and of freedom, but God himself gave them the means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of remaining equal and free, by placing them upon a boundless continent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is open to their exertions. General prosperity is favorable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the stability of all governments, but more particularly of a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitution, which depends upon the dispositions of the majority, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more particularly of that portion of the community which is most exposed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to feel the pressure of want. When the people rules, it must be rendered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happy, or it will overturn the State, and misery is apt to stimulate it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to those excesses to which ambition rouses kings. The physical causes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are more numerous in America than they have ever been in any other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country in the world, at any other period of history. In the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States not only is legislation democratic, but nature herself favors the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cause of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that which is occurring under our eyes in North America? The celebrated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,communities of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could flourish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in their place. Even the moderns have found, in some parts of South","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, vast regions inhabited by a people of inferior civilization,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found their new states,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous population, until","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civilization has been made to blush for their success. But North America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"natural riches of the soil, and that vast country was still, properly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its inhabitants.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Everything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the inhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon which these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When man was first placed upon the earth by the Creator, the earth was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inexhaustible in its youth, but man was weak and ignorant; and when he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had learned to explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,asylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that same period,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"North America was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Deity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"That continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"state it is offered to man, not in the barbarous and isolated condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the early ages, but to a being who is already in possession of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the most potent secrets of the natural world, who is united to his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-men, and instructed by the experience of fifty centuries. At","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans are peaceably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extent they are not yet themselves accurately acquainted. Three or four,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thousand soldiers drive the wandering races of the aborigines before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them; these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"off the beasts of prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,make ready the triumphal procession of civilization across the waste.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions of that country has been so often described by others,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and adverted to by myself, that I shall not enlarge upon it beyond the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,addition of a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the deserts of America are peopled by European emigrants, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"annually disembark upon the coasts of the New World, whilst the American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population increases and multiplies upon the soil which its forefathers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tilled. The European settler, however, usually arrives in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States without friends, and sometimes without resources; in order to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsist he is obliged to work for hire, and he rarely proceeds beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that belt of industrious population which adjoins the ocean. The desert,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be explored without capital or credit; and the body must be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accustomed to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the chances of forest life. It is the Americans themselves who daily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,quit the spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive domains in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a remote country. Thus the European leaves his cottage for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"trans-Atlantic shores; and the American, who is born on that very coast,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,plunges in his turn into the wilds of Central America. This double,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"emigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest parts of Europe, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the New World. Millions of men are marching at once towards the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"horizon; their language, their religion, their manners differ, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"object is the same. The gifts of fortune are promised in the West, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the West they bend their course. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote b: [The number of foreign immigrants into the United States in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the last fifty years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. Of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these, 4,104,553 spoke English--that is, they came from Great Britain,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Ireland, or the British colonies; 2,643,069 came from Germany or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,northern Europe; and about half a million from the south of Europe.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"No event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,except perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the Roman,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Empire. Then, as well as now, generations of men were impelled forwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"designs of Providence were not the same; then, every newcomer was the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"harbinger of destruction and of death; now, every adventurer brings with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,him the elements of prosperity and of life. The future still conceals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,towards the West; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,results. As a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the States in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which they were born, the population of these States increases very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slowly, although they have long been established: thus in Connecticut,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which only contains fifty-nine inhabitants to the square mile, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"population has not increased by more than one-quarter in forty years,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst that of England has been augmented by one-third in the lapse of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same period. The European emigrant always lands, therefore, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a country which is but half full, and where hands are in request:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his son goes to seek his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a rich landowner. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"former amasses the capital which the latter invests, and the stranger as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,well as the native is unacquainted with want.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of property; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,property from being divided to excess. *c This is very perceptible in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the States which are beginning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is the most populous part of the Union, but it contains only eighty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants to the square mile, which is must less than in France, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,162 are reckoned to the same extent of country. But in Massachusetts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"estates are very rarely divided; the eldest son takes the land, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,others go to seek their fortune in the desert. The law has abolished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the rights of primogeniture, but circumstances have concurred to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"re-establish it under a form of which none can complain, and by which no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,just rights are impaired.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote c: In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are rarely subjected to further division.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who leave New England, in this manner, to settle themselves in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wilds. We were assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Congress were born in the little State of Connecticut. The population of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Connecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"representatives. The States of Connecticut, however, only sends five","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,delegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new Western,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners they would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"useful members of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more than of ourselves. ""It cannot be doubted,"" says Chancellor Kent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in his ""Treatise on American Law,"" ""that the division of landed estates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,must produce great evils when it is carried to such excess as that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,each parcel of land is insufficient to support a family; but these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"disadvantages have never been felt in the United States, and many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generations must elapse before they can be felt. The extent of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent land, and the continual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stream of emigration flowing from the shores of the Atlantic towards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the interior of the country, suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevent the parcelling out of estates.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forward to secure the immense booty which fortune proffers to him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow of the Indian and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the silence of the woods;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,onwards by a passion more intense than the love of life. Before him lies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if time pressed, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have spoken of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"emigration from the older States, but how shall I describe that which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,takes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,since that of Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not born within its confines; its capital has only been built thirty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"years, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uncultivated fields; nevertheless the population of Ohio is already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proceeding westward, and most of the settlers who descend to the fertile","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,savannahs of Illinois are citizens of Ohio. These men left their first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country to improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ameliorate it still more; fortune awaits them everywhere, but happiness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they cannot attain. The desire of prosperity is become an ardent and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,restless passion in their minds which grows by what it gains. They early,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"broke the ties which bound them to their natal earth, and they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contracted no fresh ones on their way. Emigration was at first necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to them as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites as much as for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gain it procures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Sometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"behind him. The woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when he has passed. It is not uncommon in crossing the new States of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the West to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traveller frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"solitary retreats, which bear witness to the power, and no less to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and over these ruins of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation, the beasts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resume the haunts which were once their own, and Nature covers the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"traces of man's path with branches and with flowers, which obliterate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his evanescent track.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cover the State of New York, I reached the shores of a lake embosomed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forests coeval with the world. A small island, covered with woods whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the waters.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Upon the shores of the lake no object attested the presence of man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,except a column of smoke which might be seen on the horizon rising from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming to hang from heaven","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rather than to be mounting to the sky. An Indian shallop was hauled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet that had first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attracted my attention, and in a few minutes I set foot upon its banks.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The whole island formed one of those delicious solitudes of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,World which almost lead civilized man to regret the haunts of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,savage. A luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fruitfulness of the soil. The deep silence which is common to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wilds of North America was only broken by the hoarse cooing of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of trees.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I was far from supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited, so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,completely did Nature seem to be left to her own caprices; but when I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered some traces,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and I soon perceived that a European had undoubtedly been led to seek a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,refuge in this retreat. Yet what changes had taken place in the scene of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his labors! The logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"verdure, and his cabin was transformed into a bower. In the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these shrubs a few stones were to be seen, blackened with fire and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt been, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some time in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,silent admiration of the exuberance of Nature and the littleness of man:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and when I was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, I exclaimed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with melancholy, ""Are ruins, then, already here?""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"desire of riches, and an excessive love of independence, as propensities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very formidable to society. Yet these are the very elements which ensure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a long and peaceful duration to the republics of America. Without these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unquiet passions the population would collect in certain spots, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"would soon be subject to wants like those of the Old World, which it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficult to satisfy; for such is the present good fortune of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"World, that the vices of its inhabitants are scarcely less favorable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to society than their virtues. These circumstances exercise a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence on the estimation in which human actions are held in the two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hemispheres. The Americans frequently term what we should call cupidity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consider to be the virtue of moderate desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In France, simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attachments which men feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as great guarantees of the tranquillity and happiness of the State. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in America nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"virtues. The French Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"traditions of their pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon their small territory; and this little community, which has so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey to the calamities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incident to old nations. In Canada, the most enlightened, patriotic,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and humane inhabitants make extraordinary efforts to render the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it. There,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal as the charms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an honest but limited income in the Old World, and more exertions are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,made to excite the passions of the citizens there than to calm them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elsewhere. If we listen to their eulogies, we shall hear that nothing is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even the poor man tastes in his own country for the dull delights of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity under a foreign sky; to leave the patrimonial hearth and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in short, to abandon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,living and the dead in quest of fortune.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At the present time America presents a field for human effort far more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to work it. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America too much knowledge cannot be diffused; for all knowledge, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who are without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they can be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,satisfied without difficulty; the growth of human passions need not be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dreaded, since all passions may find an easy and a legitimate object;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nor can men be put in possession of too much freedom, since they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American republics of the present day are like companies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,adventurers formed to explore in common the waste lands of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"World, and busied in a flourishing trade. The passions which agitate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Americans most deeply are not their political but their commercial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passions; or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contract in business into their political life. They love order, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial value upon a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prefer the good sense which amasses large fortunes to that enterprising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spirit which frequently dissipates them; general ideas alarm their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"minds, which are accustomed to positive calculations, and they hold","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,practice in more honor than theory.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is in America that one learns to understand the influence which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"physical prosperity exercises over political actions, and even over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that of reason; and it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is more especially amongst strangers that this truth is perceptible.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Most of the European emigrants to the New World carry with them that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wild love of independence and of change which our calamities are so apt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to engender. I sometimes met with Europeans in the United States who had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been obliged to leave their own country on account of their political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions. They all astonished me by the language they held, but one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them surprised me more than all the rest. As I was crossing one of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most remote districts of Pennsylvania I was benighted, and obliged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Frenchman by birth. He bade me sit down beside his fire, and we began to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"talk with that freedom which befits persons who meet in the backwoods,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,two thousand leagues from their native country. I was aware that my host,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had been a great leveller and an ardent demagogue forty years ago, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that his name was not unknown to fame. I was, therefore, not a little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,surprised to hear him discuss the rights of property as an economist or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a landowner might have done: he spoke of the necessary gradations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fortune establishes among men, of obedience to established laws, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the influence of good morals in commonwealths, and of the support which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious opinions give to order and to freedom; he even went to far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as to quote an evangelical authority in corroboration of one of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political tenets.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proposition is true or false, but no art can prove it to be one or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other, in the midst of the uncertainties of science and the conflicting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lessons of experience, until a new incident disperses the clouds of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"doubt; I was poor, I become rich, and I am not to expect that prosperity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"will act upon my conduct, and leave my judgment free; my opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"change with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I turn to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wanting. The influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American than upon strangers. The American has always seen the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"connection of public order and public prosperity, intimately united","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as they are, go on before his eyes; he does not conceive that one can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subsist without the other; he has therefore nothing to forget; nor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has he, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the lessons of his early","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,education.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,If I have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,I have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,considered as one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic republic in the United States is attributable. I here used,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the word manners with the meaning which the ancients attached to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"word mores, for I apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"what constitutes the character of social intercourse, but I extend it to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the various notions and opinions current among men, and to the mass","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I comprise,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a people. My intention is not to draw a picture of American manners,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintenance of political institutions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Every religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"to follow its own bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions of society upon one uniform principle; and man will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"endeavor, if I may use the expression, to harmonize the state in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he lives upon earth with the state which he believes to await him in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heaven. The greatest part of British America was peopled by men who,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after having shaken off the authority of the Pope, acknowledged no other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious supremacy; they brought with them into the New World a form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Christianity which I cannot better describe than by styling it a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democratic and republican religion. This sect contributed powerfully to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the establishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the earliest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,settlement of the emigrants politics and religion contracted an alliance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which has never been dissolved.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,their doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the most republican and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most democratic class of citizens which exists in the United States;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the causes by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"writer in the ""Edinburgh Review"" (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) affirmed that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole Catholic population of the United States was then about 4,000,000,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"divided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches, under the care of 45","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,by immigration from the Catholic countries of Europe.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the natural enemy of democracy. Amongst the various sects of Christians,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Catholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of those which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most favorable to the equality of conditions. In the Catholic Church,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the religious community is composed of only two elements, the priest and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the people. The priest alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,below him are equal.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,On doctrinal points the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same level; it subjects the wise and ignorant, the man of genius and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the vulgar crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observances upon the rich and needy, it inflicts the same austerities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon the strong and the weak, it listens to no compromise with mortal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"man, but, reducing all the human race to the same standard, it confounds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all the distinctions of society at the foot of the same altar, even as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are confounded in the sight of God. If Catholicism predisposes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the faithful to obedience, it certainly does not prepare them for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inequality; but the contrary may be said of Protestantism, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"generally tends to make men independent, more than to render them equal.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the other classes of society are more equal than they are in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republics. It has not unfrequently occurred that the Catholic priest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"society, and to take his place amongst the civil gradations of men. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious influence has sometimes been used to secure the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of that political state of things to which he belonged. At other times,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Catholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit of religion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as is the case in the United States, than is found that no class of men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are more naturally disposed than the Catholics to transfuse the doctrine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the equality of conditions into the political world. If, then, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Catholic citizens of the United States are not forcibly led by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature of their tenets to adopt democratic and republican principles,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and their social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"position, as well as their limited number, obliges them to adopt these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and they have no chance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taking a part in the government unless it be open to all the citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"They constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected in order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to insure to them the free exercise of their own privileges. These two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"causes induce them, unconsciously, to adopt political doctrines,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they would perhaps support with less zeal if they were rich and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preponderant.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this political tendency, but it seeks rather to justify its results. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,priests in America have divided the intellectual world into two parts:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the one they place the doctrines of revealed religion, which command","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their assent; in the other they leave those truths which they believe to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have been freely left open to the researches of political inquiry.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thus the Catholics of the United States are at the same time the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,faithful believers and the most zealous citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,displays the slightest hostility to democratic and republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions. The clergy of all the different sects hold the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"language, their opinions are consonant to the laws, and the human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intellect flows onwards in one sole current.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I was invited to attend a public meeting which had been called for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purpose of assisting the Poles, and of sending them supplies of arms and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,money. I found two or three thousand persons collected in a vast hall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which had been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst he spoke in the following","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,terms:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""Almighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and guide the arms of our fathers when they were fighting for the sacred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rights of national independence; Thou who didst make them triumph over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a hateful oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of liberty and peace; Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic nation which is even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"now struggling as we did in the former time, and for the same rights","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst create Man in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"likeness of the same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and establish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do Thou watch over the destiny,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May Thy wisdom direct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their councils, and may Thy strength sustain their arms! Shed forth Thy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"terror over their enemies, scatter the powers which take counsel against","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them; and vouchsafe that the injustice which the world has witnessed for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fifty years, be not consummated in our time. O Lord, who holdest alike","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the hearts of nations and of men in Thy powerful hand; raise up allies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the sacred cause of right; arouse the French nation from the apathy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,liberties of the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"still more considerable, and it never instructs the Americans more fully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the art of being free than when it says nothing of freedom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"highest importance to man, as an individual, that his religion should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"true, the case of society is not the same. Society has no future life to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,peculiar tenets of that religion are of very little importance to its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests. Moreover, almost all the sects of the United States are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"comprised within the great unity of Christianity, and Christian morality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is everywhere the same.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may be believed without unfairness that a certain number of Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pursue a peculiar form of worship, from habit more than from conviction.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States the sovereign authority is religious, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequently hypocrisy must be common; but there is no country in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over the souls of men than in America; and there can be no greater proof,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature, than that its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence is most powerfully felt over the most enlightened and free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nation of the earth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without even excepting those who do not admit religious liberty, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all in favor of civil freedom; but they do not support any particular,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political system. They keep aloof from parties and from public affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States religion exercises but little influence upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"laws and upon the details of public opinion, but it directs the manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the community, and by regulating domestic life it regulates the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I do not question that the great austerity of manners which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observable in the United States, arises, in the first instance, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious faith. Religion is often unable to restrain man from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,numberless temptations of fortune; nor can it check that passion for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gain which every incident of his life contributes to arouse, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its influence over the mind of woman is supreme, and women are the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protectors of morals. There is certainly no country in the world,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. In Europe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,domestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"home, is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which frequently disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obedience which the legislative powers of the State exact. But when the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American retires from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"family, he finds in it the image of order and of peace. There his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasures are simple and natural, his joys are innocent and calm; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to happiness, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,accustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions as well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as his tastes. Whilst the European endeavors to forget his domestic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"troubles by agitating society, the American derives from his own home","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that love of order which he afterwards carries with him into public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affairs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manners, but it extends to the intelligence of the people. Amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Anglo-Americans, there are some who profess the doctrines of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Christianity from a sincere belief in them, and others who do the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"because they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. Christianity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal consent; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abandoned to the debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cannot surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain primal and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immutable principles are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,human device are subjected to certain forms which retard and stop their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,completion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumspect and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unfinished. These habits of restraint recur in political society, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the people and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the durability of the institutions it has established. Nature and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they seek for fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring innovators","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the most implacable disputants in the world. But the revolutionists,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of America are obliged to profess an ostensible respect for Christian,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"morality and equity, which does not easily permit them to violate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws that oppose their designs; nor would they find it easy to surmount,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the scruples of their partisans, even if they were able to get over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own. Hitherto no one in the United States has dared to advance the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"maxim, that everything is permissible with a view to the interests of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society; an impious adage which seems to have been invented in an age of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,freedom to shelter all the tyrants of future ages. Thus whilst the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"permits the Americans to do what they please, religion prevents them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what is rash or unjust.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Religion in America takes no direct part in the government of society,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions of that country; for if it does not impart a taste for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"freedom, it facilitates the use of free institutions. Indeed, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in this same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans have a sincere faith in their religion, for who can search the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,human heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation, and to every rank of society.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not prevent even the partisans of that very sect from supporting him;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but if he attacks all the sects together, everyone abandons him, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,disbelief in the existence of God. The presiding judge remarked that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he had not before been aware that there was a man living who did not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,believe in the existence of God; that this belief constituted the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sanction of all testimony in a court of justice, and that he knew of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no cause in a Christian country where a witness had been permitted to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"testify without such belief.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the one without the other; and with them this conviction does not spring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rather than to live.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Gospel into the new Western States to found schools and churches,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"there, lest religion should be suffered to die away in those remote","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"settlements, and the rising States be less fitted to enjoy free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions than the people from which they emanated. I met with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wealthy New Englanders who abandoned the country in which they were born,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in order to lay the foundations of Christianity and of freedom on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"banks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of Illinois. Thus religious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,zeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the duties of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotism. These men do not act from an exclusive consideration of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,promises of a future life; eternity is only one motive of their devotion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Christian,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the goods of this world, and that you meet with a politician where you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expected to find a priest. They will tell you that ""all the American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republics are collectively involved with each other; if the republics of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the republican institutions which now flourish upon the shores of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Atlantic Ocean would be in great peril. It is, therefore, our interest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that the new States should be religious, in order to maintain our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberties.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Such are the opinions of the Americans, and if any hold that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religious spirit which I admire is the very thing most amiss in America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and that the only element wanting to the freedom and happiness of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human race is to believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Cabanis the secretion of thought by the brain, I can only reply that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those who hold this language have never been in America, and that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have never seen a religious or a free nation. When they return from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"temporary means of power, of wealth, and distinction; men who are the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condottieri of liberty, and who fight for their own advantage, whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be the colors they wear: it is not to these that I address myself. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there are others who look forward to the republican form of government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as a tranquil and lasting state, towards which modern society is daily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impelled by the ideas and manners of the time, and who sincerely desire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to prepare men to be free. When these men attack religious opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they obey the dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests. Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Religion is much more necessary in the republic which they set forth in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,glowing colors than in the monarchy which they attack; and it is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,needed in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that society should escape destruction if the moral tie be not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed? and what can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of religious faith in a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must necessarily fail, the more generally liberty is established and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"knowledge diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unbelief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debasement,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst in America one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,world fulfils all the outward duties of religious fervor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Upon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stayed there the more did I perceive the great political consequences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resulting from this state of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,France I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America I found that they were intimately united, and that they reigned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,questioned the members of all the different sects; and I more especially,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different persuasions, and who are more especially interested in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their duration. As a member of the Roman Catholic Church I was more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"particularly brought into contact with several of its priests, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,astonishment and I explained my doubts; I found that they differed upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,matters of detail alone; and that they mainly attributed the peaceful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dominion of religion in their country to the separation of Church and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was not of the same opinion upon this point.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,station which the American clergy occupy in political society. I learned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with surprise that they filled no public appointments; *f not one of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them is to be met with in the administration, and they are not even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represented in the legislative assemblies. In several States *g the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excludes them from political life, public opinion in all. And when I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy I found that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their profession","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to abstain from politics.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote f: Unless this term be applied to the functions which many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from their discourses that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinions concerning political government which they may profess with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or in driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the gospel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,eschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant upon personal interest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These facts convinced me that what I had been told was true; and it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then became my object to investigate their causes, and to inquire how it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,happened that the real authority of religion was increased by a state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of things which diminished its apparent force: these causes did not long,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,escape my researches.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The short space of threescore years can never content the imagination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alone, of all created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,annihilation. These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the contemplation of a future state, and religion directs his musings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope; and it is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a sort of violent distortion of their true natures; but they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,invincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consider religious institutions in a purely human point of view, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be said to derive an inexhaustible element of strength from man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"himself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this influence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which originates in itself, by the artificial power of the laws, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the support of those temporal institutions which direct society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Religions, intimately united to the governments of the earth, have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,known to exercise a sovereign authority derived from the twofold source,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of terror and of faith; but when a religion contracts an alliance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that it commits the same error","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as a man who should sacrifice his future to his present welfare; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks that authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is rightfully its own. When a religion founds its empire upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"desire of immortality which lives in every human heart, it may aspire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations. Thus, in forming an alliance with a political power, religion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"augments its authority over a few, and forfeits the hope of reigning","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over all.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of mankind.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But if it be mixed up with the bitter passions of the world, it may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of love, have given to it; or to repel as antagonists men who are still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attached to its own spirit, however opposed they may be to the powers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to which it is allied. The Church cannot share the temporal power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State without being the object of a portion of that animosity which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter excites.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The political powers which seem to be most firmly established have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,frequently no better guarantee for their duration than the opinions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a generation, the interests of the time, or the life of an individual.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A law may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,determinate; and with the social condition everything else must change.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The powers of society are more or less fugitive, like the years which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"we spend upon the earth; they succeed each other with rapidity, like the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fleeting cares of life; and no government has ever yet been founded upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an invariable disposition of the human heart, or upon an imperishable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As long as a religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and passions which are found to occur under the same forms, at all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different periods of history, it may defy the efforts of time; or at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,least it can only be destroyed by another religion. But when religion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"clings to the interests of the world, it becomes almost as fragile a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thing as the powers of earth. It is the only one of them all which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can hope for immortality; but if it be connected with their ephemeral,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with those transient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions which supported them for a day. The alliance which religion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contracts with political powers must needs be onerous to itself; since,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it does not require their assistance to live, and by giving them its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assistance to live, and by giving them its assistance it may be exposed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to decay.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not always equally visible. In some ages governments seem to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imperishable; in others, the existence of society appears to be more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,precarious than the life of man. Some constitutions plunge the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens into a lethargic somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excitement. When governments appear to be so strong, and laws so stable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union of Church,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and State. When governments display so much weakness, and laws so much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inconstancy, the danger is self-evident, but it is no longer possible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to avoid it; to be effectual, measures must be taken to discover its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,approach.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as communities display democratic propensities, it becomes more and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous to connect religion with political institutions; for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time is coming when authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political theories will succeed each other, and when men, laws, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitutions will disappear, or be modified from day to day, and this,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not for a season only, but unceasingly. Agitation and mutability are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inherent in the nature of democratic republics, just as stagnation and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inertness are the law of absolute monarchies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If the Americans, who change the head of the Government once in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"four years, who elect new legislators every two years, and renew the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provincial officers every twelvemonth; if the Americans, who have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abandoned the political world to the attempts of innovators, had not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"placed religion beyond their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,flow of human opinions? where would that respect which belongs to it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be paid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the first to perceive this truth, and to act in conformity with it. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"saw that they must renounce their religious influence, if they were to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strive for political power; and they chose to give up the support of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"State, rather than to share its vicissitudes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,certain periods in the history of certain peoples; but its influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is more lasting. It restricts itself to its own resources, but of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"none can deprive it: its circle is limited to certain principles, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those principles are entirely its own, and under its undisputed control.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,On every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religious faith, and inquiring the means of restoring to religion some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remnant of its pristine authority. It seems to me that we must first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attentively consider what ought to be the natural state of men with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regard to religion at the present time; and when we know what we have to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hope and to fear, we may discern the end to which our efforts ought to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be directed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"schism and indifference. In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abandon their religion, but they only shake it off in order to adopt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"another. Their faith changes the objects to which it is directed, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it suffers no decline. The old religion then excites enthusiastic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attachment or bitter enmity in either party; some leave it with anger,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others cling to it with increased devotedness, and although persuasions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"differ, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the case when a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be termed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negative, since they deny the truth of one religion without affirming","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of any other. Progidious revolutions then take place in the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mind, without the apparent co-operation of the passions of man, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost without his knowledge. Men lose the objects of their fondest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hopes, as if through forgetfulness. They are carried away by an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem, but which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they love, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a scepticism that plunges them into despair.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinions from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them, but the sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if the unbeliever does not admit religion to be true, he still considers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it useful. Regarding religious institutions in a human point of view,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he acknowledges their influence upon manners and legislation. He admits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that they may serve to make men live in peace with one another, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prepare them gently for the hour of death. He regrets the faith which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which he has learned to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"estimate at its full value, he scruples to take it from those who still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possess it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, those who continue to believe are not afraid openly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to avow their faith. They look upon those who do not share their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,persuasion as more worthy of pity than of opposition; and they are aware,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not obliged to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,they do not consider the society in which they live as an arena in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes, they love their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contemporaries, whilst they condemn their weaknesses and lament their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,errors.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"believe, display their faith, public opinion pronounces itself in favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of religion: love, support, and honor are bestowed upon it, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only by searching the human soul that we can detect the wounds which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has received. The mass of mankind, who are never without the feeling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of religion, do not perceive anything at variance with the established","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,faith. The instinctive desire of a future life brings the crowd about,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the altar, and opens the hearts of men to the precepts and consolations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of religion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But this picture is not applicable to us: for there are men amongst us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who have ceased to believe in Christianity, without adopting any other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"religion; others who are in the perplexities of doubt, and who already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affect not to believe; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Christian faith which they still cherish in secret.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Amidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"believers exist, who are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangers in defence of their faith. They have done violence to human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weakness, in order to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effort they have made, they scarcely knew where to stop; and as they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,know that the first use which the French made of independence was to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attack religion, they look upon their contemporaries with dread, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they recoil in alarm from the liberty which their fellow-citizens are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seeking to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They are at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"war with their age and country, and they look upon every opinion which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Such is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,work in France to prevent the human mind from following its original,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,propensities and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,naturally to stop. I am intimately convinced that this extraordinary and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incidental cause is the close connection of politics and religion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The unbelievers of Europe attack the Christians as their political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opponents, rather than as their religious adversaries; they hate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Christian religion as the opinion of a party, much more than as an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,error of belief; and they reject the clergy less because they are the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of the Divinity than because they are the allies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the earth. Those powers are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,under their ruins. The living body of religion has been bound down,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the dead corpse of superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"restrain it, and that which is alive will rise once more. I know not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possesses no great historians, and not a single eminent poet. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants of that country look upon what are properly styled literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,pursuits with a kind of disapprobation; and there are towns of very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,second-rate importance in Europe in which more literary works are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,annually published than in the twenty-four States of the Union put,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,together. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas; and it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor manufactures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,direct them to these occupations; and although new laws are perpetually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enacted in the United States, no great writers have hitherto inquired","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,into the general principles of their legislation. The Americans have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they furnish examples","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rather than lessons to the world. The same observation applies to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mechanical arts. In America, the inventions of Europe are adopted with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sagacity; they are perfected, and adapted with admirable skill to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wants of the country. Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is not cultivated; and they have good workmen, but very few inventors.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"community in the world. The whole population, as I observed in another","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"place, is situated between these two extremes. In New England, every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his religion, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"history of his country, and the leading features of its Constitution.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is extremely rare to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"South, the instruction of the people diminishes. In the States which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be found, as in our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instruction. But there is not a single district in the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason: the peoples,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous condition, to advance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,toward the light of civilization; their progress has been unequal;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some of them have improved apace, whilst others have loitered in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Such has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"settled in a state of civilization, upon that territory which their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"descendants occupy; they had not to begin to learn, and it was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sufficient for them not to forget. Now the children of these same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans are the persons who, year by year, transport their dwellings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,into the wilds; and with their dwellings their acquired information and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their esteem for knowledge. Education has taught them the utility of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"posterity. In the United States society has no infancy, but it is born","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in man's estate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans never use the word ""peasant,"" because they have no idea of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the villager","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike unacquainted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of an early stage of civilization. At the extreme borders of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Confederate States, upon the confines of society and of the wilderness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a population of bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the solitudes of the American woods, and seek a country there, in order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to escape that poverty which awaited them in their native provinces. As,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,soon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot which is to serve him for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. Nothing can offer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The traveller,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who approaches one of them towards nightfall, sees the flicker of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls; and at night, if the wind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great forest trees. Who would not suppose that this poor hut is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,asylum of rudeness and ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the pioneer and the dwelling which shelters him. Everything,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"about him is primitive and unformed, but he is himself the result of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"labor and the experience of eighteen centuries. He wears the dress,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and he speaks the language of cities; he is acquainted with the past,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"curious of the future, and ready for argument upon the present; he is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a time, to inhabit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the New World with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinion circulates in the midst of these deserts. *j I do not think that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so much intellectual intercourse takes place in the most enlightened,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and populous districts of France. *k It cannot be doubted that, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States, the instruction of the people powerfully contributes to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the support of a democratic republic; and such must always be the case,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I believe, where instruction which awakens the understanding is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,separated from moral education which amends the heart. But I by no means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exaggerate this benefit, and I am still further from thinking, as so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many people do think in Europe, that men can be instantaneously made","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizens by teaching them to read and write. True information is mainly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derived from experience; and if the Americans had not been gradually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not assist","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"out, through immense forests; when the gloom of the woods became","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impenetrable the coachman lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,along by the light they cast. From time to time we came to a hut in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the ignorant all over the world. But if you question him respecting his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own country, the cloud which dimmed his intelligence will immediately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disperse; his language will become as clear and as precise as his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by what means he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercises them; he will be able to point out the customs which obtain in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"rules of the administration, and that he is familiar with the mechanism","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the laws. The citizen of the United States does not acquire his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,practical science and his positive notions from books; the instruction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he has acquired may have prepared him for receiving those ideas, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it did not furnish them. The American learns to know the laws by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,participating in the act of legislation; and he takes a lesson in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forms of government from governing. The great work of society is ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,circumstance is by no means peculiar to the United States; almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. The passion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wealth takes the place of ambition, and the warmth of faction is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mitigated by a sense of prosperity. But in what portion of the globe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shall we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more unexplored and inexhaustible riches than in South America?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions. If the welfare of nations depended on their being placed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before them, the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,complain of their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than the inhabitants of the United States, their lot might still be such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There are, however, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nations upon the face of the earth more miserable than those of South,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce results","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"analogous to those which occur in North America, but they are unable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to raise the population of South America above the level of European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, where they act in a contrary direction. Physical causes do not,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore, affect the destiny of nations so much as has been supposed.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have met with men in New England who were on the point of leaving a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seek their fortune in the wilds. Not far from that district I found,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a French population in Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"territory, although the same wilds were at hand; and whilst the emigrant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the United States purchased an extensive estate with the earnings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of a short term of labor, the Canadian paid as much for land as he would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have done in France. Nature offers the solitudes of the New World to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europeans; but they are not always acquainted with the means of turning,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,her gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans, but without their laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and their manners; and these peoples are wretched. The laws and manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Anglo-Americans are therefore that efficient cause of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,greatness which is the object of my inquiry.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am far from supposing that the American laws are preeminently good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in themselves; I do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peoples; and several of them seem to be dangerous, even in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the American legislation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"taken collectively, is extremely well adapted to the genius of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people and the nature of the country which it is intended to govern. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American laws are therefore good, and to them must be attributed a large","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,portion of the success which attends the government of democracy in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America: but I do not believe them to be the principal cause of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,success; and if they seem to me to have more influence upon the social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happiness of the Americans than the nature of the country, on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hand there is reason to believe that their effect is still inferior to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that produced by the manners of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Federal laws undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"legislation of the United States. Mexico, which is not less fortunately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"situated than the Anglo-American Union, has adopted the same laws, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is unable to accustom itself to the government of democracy. Some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other cause is therefore at work, independently of those physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances and peculiar laws which enable the democracy to rule in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Another still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants of the territory of the Union are the descendants of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"common stock; they speak the same language, they worship God in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manner, they are affected by the same physical causes, and they obey the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same laws. Whence, then, do their characteristic differences arise?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Why, in the Eastern States of the Union, does the republican government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"display vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature deliberation?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whence does it derive the wisdom and the durability which mark its acts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whilst in the Western States, on the contrary, society seems to be ruled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the powers of chance? There, public business is conducted with an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"irregularity and a passionate and feverish excitement, which does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,announce a long or sure duration.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am no longer comparing the Anglo-American States to foreign nations;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but I am contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,why they are so unlike. The arguments which are derived from the nature,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the country and the difference of legislation are here all set aside.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Recourse must be had to some other cause; and what other cause can there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be except the manners of the people?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is in the Eastern States that the Anglo-Americans have been longest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"accustomed to the government of democracy, and that they have adopted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Democracy has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the forms of social intercourse; it is to be found in all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,details of daily life equally as in the laws. In the Eastern States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the instruction and practical education of the people have been most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfected, and religion has been most thoroughly amalgamated with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty. Now these habits, opinions, customs, and convictions are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,precisely the constituent elements of that which I have denominated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manners.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the Western States, on the contrary, a portion of the same advantages","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is still wanting. Many of the Americans of the West were born in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"woods, and they mix the ideas and the customs of savage life with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civilization of their parents. Their passions are more intense; their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,religious morality less authoritative; and their convictions less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,secure. The inhabitants exercise no sort of control over their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted with each other. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations of the West display, to a certain extent, the inexperience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the rude habits of a people in its infancy; for although they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"composed of old elements, their assemblage is of recent date.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The manners of the Americans of the United States are, then, the real","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cause which renders that people the only one of the American nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that is able to support a democratic government; and it is the influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of manners which produces the different degrees of order and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity that may be distinguished in the several Anglo-American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democracies. Thus the effect which the geographical position of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country may have upon the duration of democratic institutions is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exaggerated in Europe. Too much importance is attributed to legislation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"too little to manners. These three great causes serve, no doubt, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regulate and direct the American democracy; but if they were to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be classed in their proper order, I should say that the physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances are less efficient than the laws, and the laws very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subordinate to the manners of the people. I am convinced that the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantageous situation and the best possible laws cannot maintain a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constitution in spite of the manners of a country; whilst the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may turn the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws to some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,advantage. The importance of manners is a common truth to which study,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and experience incessantly direct our attention. It may be regarded as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a central point in the range of human observation, and the common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"termination of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that if I have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence which I attribute to the practical experience, the habits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the opinions, in short, to the manners of the Americans, upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"maintenance of their institutions, I have failed in the principal object","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of my work.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whether Laws And Manners Are Sufficient To Maintain Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Institutions In Other Countries Besides America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be obliged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to modify their laws--Distinction to be made between democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions and American institutions--Democratic laws may be conceived,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"better than, or at least different from, those which the American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democracy has adopted--The example of America only proves that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is possible to regulate democracy by the assistance of manners and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,legislation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States is more intimately connected with the laws themselves, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the manners of the people, than with the nature of the country. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,does it follow that the same causes would of themselves produce the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"results, if they were put into operation elsewhere; and if the country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is no adequate substitute for laws and manners, can laws and manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in their turn prove a substitute for the country? It will readily be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,understood that the necessary elements of a reply to this question are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wanting: other peoples are to be found in the New World besides the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans, and as these people are affected by the same physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared together. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there are no nations out of America which have adopted the same laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and manners, being destitute of the physical advantages peculiar to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans. No standard of comparison therefore exists, and we can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only hazard an opinion upon this subject.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It appears to me, in the first place, that a careful distinction must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be made between the institutions of the United States and democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions in general. When I reflect upon the state of Europe, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mighty nations, its populous cities, its formidable armies, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the complex nature of its politics, I cannot suppose that even the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans, if they were transported to our hemisphere, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their ideas, their religion, and their manners, could exist without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,considerably altering their laws. But a democratic nation may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imagined, organized differently from the American people. It is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible to conceive a government really established upon the will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the majority; but in which the majority, repressing its natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"propensity to equality, should consent, with a view to the order and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stability of the State, to invest a family or an individual with all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the prerogatives of the executive. A democratic society might exist, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the forces of the nation would be more centralized than they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the United States; the people would exercise a less direct and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less irresistible influence upon public affairs, and yet every citizen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"invested with certain rights would participate, within his sphere,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the conduct of the government. The observations I made amongst the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Anglo-Americans induce me to believe that democratic institutions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this kind, prudently introduced into society, so as gradually to mix","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the habits and to be interfused with the opinions of the people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,might subsist in other countries besides America. If the laws of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"United States were the only imaginable democratic laws, or the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perfect which it is possible to conceive, I should admit that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,success of those institutions affords no proof of the success of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic institutions in general, in a country less favored by natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances. But as the laws of America appear to me to be defective,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in several respects, and as I can readily imagine others of the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general nature, the peculiar advantages of that country do not prove","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that democratic institutions cannot succeed in a nation less favored by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumstances, if ruled by better laws.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If human nature were different in America from what it is elsewhere; or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if the social condition of the Americans engendered habits and opinions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amongst them different from those which originate in the same social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condition in the Old World, the American democracies would afford","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no means of predicting what may occur in other democracies. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans displayed the same propensities as all other democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations, and if their legislators had relied upon the nature of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country and the favor of circumstances to restrain those propensities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within due limits, the prosperity of the United States would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"encouragement to a people inclined to imitate their example, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sharing their natural advantages. But neither of these suppositions is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,borne out by facts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In America the same passions are to be met with as in Europe; some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"originating in human nature, others in the democratic condition of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society. Thus in the United States I found that restlessness of heart,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is natural to men, when all ranks are nearly equal and the chances","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of elevation are the same to all. I found the democratic feeling of envy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expressed under a thousand different forms. I remarked that the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"frequently displayed, in the conduct of affairs, a consummate mixture","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of ignorance and presumption; and I inferred that in America, men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are liable to the same failings and the same absurdities as amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ourselves. But upon examining the state of society more attentively,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I speedily discovered that the Americans had made great and successful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"efforts to counteract these imperfections of human nature, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,correct the natural defects of democracy. Their divers municipal laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,appeared to me to be a means of restraining the ambition of the citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within a narrow sphere, and of turning those same passions which might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have worked havoc in the State, to the good of the township or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,parish. The American legislators have succeeded to a certain extent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposing the notion of rights to the feelings of envy; the permanence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the religious world to the continual shifting of politics; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,experience of the people to its theoretical ignorance; and its practical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,knowledge of business to the impatience of its desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans, then, have not relied upon the nature of their country to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,counterpoise those dangers which originate in their Constitution and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in their political laws. To evils which are common to all democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peoples they have applied remedies which none but themselves had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ever thought of before; and although they were the first to make the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"experiment, they have succeeded in it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The manners and laws of the Americans are not the only ones which may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,suit a democratic people; but the Americans have shown that it would be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wrong to despair of regulating democracy by the aid of manners and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws. If other nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Americans, without however intending to imitate them in the peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,application which they have made of it; if they should attempt to fit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves for that social condition, which it seems to be the will of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Providence to impose upon the generations of this age, and so to escape","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the despotism or the anarchy which threatens them; what reason is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned with success?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The organization and the establishment of democracy in Christendom is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the great political problem of the time. The Americans, unquestionably,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have not resolved this problem, but they furnish useful data to those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who undertake the task.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Importance Of What Precedes With Respect To The State Of Europe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It may readily be discovered with what intention I undertook the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foregoing inquiries. The question here discussed is interesting not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the United States, but to the whole world; it concerns, not a nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but all mankind. If those nations whose social condition is democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"could only remain free as long as they are inhabitants of the wilds,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,we could not but despair of the future destiny of the human race; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended sway, and the wilds are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,gradually peopled with men. If it were true that laws and manners are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insufficient to maintain democratic institutions, what refuge would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remain open to the nations, except the despotism of a single individual?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am aware that there are many worthy persons at the present time who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who are so tired of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"liberty as to be glad of repose, far from those storms by which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is attended. But these individuals are ill acquainted with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,haven towards which they are bound. They are so deluded by their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"recollections, as to judge the tendency of absolute power by what it was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formerly, and not by what it might become at the present time.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If absolute power were re-established amongst the democratic nations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe, I am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,features unknown to our forefathers. There was a time in Europe when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the laws and the consent of the people had invested princes with almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unlimited authority; but they scarcely ever availed themselves of it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I do not speak of the prerogatives of the nobility, of the authority of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supreme courts of justice, of corporations and their chartered rights,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or of provincial privileges, which served to break the blows of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign authority, and to maintain a spirit of resistance in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation. Independently of these political institutions--which, however","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opposed they might be to personal liberty, served to keep alive the love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of freedom in the mind of the public, and which may be esteemed to have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been useful in this respect--the manners and opinions of the nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confined the royal authority within barriers which were not less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powerful, although they were less conspicuous. Religion, the affections","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the people, the benevolence of the prince, the sense of honor, family","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pride, provincial prejudices, custom, and public opinion limited the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power of kings, and restrained their authority within an invisible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circle. The constitution of nations was despotic at that time, but their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manners were free. Princes had the right, but they had neither the means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nor the desire, of doing whatever they pleased.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aggressions of tyranny? Since religion has lost its empire over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"souls of men, the most prominent boundary which divided good from evil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is overthrown; the very elements of the moral world are indeterminate;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the princes and the peoples of the earth are guided by chance, and none","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can define the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Long revolutions have forever destroyed the respect which surrounded the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rulers of the State; and since they have been relieved from the burden,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of public esteem, princes may henceforward surrender themselves without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fear to the seductions of arbitrary power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned towards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them, they are clement, because they are conscious of their strength,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and they are chary of the affection of their people, because the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affection of their people is the bulwark of the throne. A mutual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interchange of good-will then takes place between the prince and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, which resembles the gracious intercourse of domestic society.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The subjects may murmur at the sovereign's decree, but they are grieved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to displease him; and the sovereign chastises his subjects with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,light hand of parental affection.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"revolution; when successive monarchs have crossed the throne, so as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alternately to display to the people the weakness of their right and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"harshness of their power, the sovereign is no longer regarded by any as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Father of the State, and he is feared by all as its master. If he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be weak, he is despised; if he be strong, he is detested. He himself is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,full of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is as a stranger in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own country, and he treats his subjects like conquered enemies.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"midst of their common country, each of them had a will of its own, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was opposed to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"parts of the same empire, after having lost their immunities, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"customs, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subjected and accustomed to the same laws, it is not more difficult to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppress them collectively than it was formerly to oppress them singly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Whilst the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long after that power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred an extraordinary degree of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"force upon their personal opposition. They afford instances of men who,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"notwithstanding their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their personal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the efforts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the public authority. But at the present day, when all ranks are more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and more confounded, when the individual disappears in the throng, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is easily lost in the midst of a common obscurity, when the honor of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,monarchy has almost lost its empire without being succeeded by public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"virtue, and when nothing can enable man to rise above himself, who shall","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,say at what point the exigencies of power and the servility of weakness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will stop?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hereditary friends, and his kinsfolk. If this support was wanting, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was sustained by his ancestors and animated by his posterity. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when patrimonial estates are divided, and when a few years suffice to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confound the distinctions of a race, where can family feeling be found?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,What force can there be in the customs of a country which has changed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and is still perpetually changing, its aspect; in which every act of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyranny has a precedent, and every crime an example; in which there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is nothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being done?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,What resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have already often yielded? What strength can even public opinion have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retained, when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie; when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not a man, nor a family, nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institution, has the power of representing or exerting that opinion;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and when every citizen--being equally weak, equally poor, and equally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dependent--has only his personal impotence to oppose to the organized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,force of the government?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that country might then be thrown. But it may more aptly be assimilated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the times of old, and to those hideous eras of Roman oppression, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the manners of the people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their habits destroyed, their opinions shaken, and freedom, expelled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the laws, could find no refuge in the land; when nothing protected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the citizens, and the citizens no longer protected themselves; when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human nature was the sport of man, and princes wearied out the clemency","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Heaven before they exhausted the patience of their subjects. Those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who hope to revive the monarchy of Henry IV or of Louis XIV, appear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when I consider the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present condition of several European nations--a condition to which all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the others tend--I am led to believe that they will soon be left with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no other alternative than democratic liberty, or the tyranny of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Caesars. *n,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,[Footnote n: [This prediction of the return of France to imperial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despotism, and of the true character of that despotic power, was written","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in 1832, and realized to the letter in 1852.]]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"And indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,entirely emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be made equal, or wholly taken away from them. If the rulers of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or to sink the citizens below that of humanity, would not the doubts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many be resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the community","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prepared to make great sacrifices with little difficulty? In that case,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the gradual growth of democratic manners and institutions should be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regarded, not as the best, but as the only means of preserving freedom;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and without liking the government of democracy, it might be adopted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as the most applicable and the fairest remedy for the present ills of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is still more difficult to supply it with experience, and to inspire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it with the feelings which it requires in order to govern well. I grant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the caprices of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its laws imperfect. But if it were true that soon no just medium would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exist between the empire of democracy and the dominion of a single arm,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,should we not rather incline towards the former than submit voluntarily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the latter? And if complete equality be our fate, is it not better to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be levelled by free institutions than by despotic power?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Those who, after having read this book, should imagine that my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intention in writing it has been to propose the laws and manners of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Anglo-Americans for the imitation of all democratic peoples, would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commit a very great mistake; they must have paid more attention to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form than to the substance of my ideas. My aim has been to show, by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"example of America, that laws, and especially manners, may exist which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will allow a democratic people to remain free. But I am very far from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,am well aware of the influence which the nature of a country and its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,political precedents exercise upon a constitution; and I should regard,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it as a great misfortune for mankind if liberty were to exist all over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the world under the same forms.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democratic institutions into France, and if we despair of imparting to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the citizens those ideas and sentiments which first prepare them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for freedom, and afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for the poor or for the rich, but an equal tyranny over all; and I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foresee that if the peaceable empire of the majority be not founded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority of a single despot.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Three Races Which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Inhabit The Territory Of The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"performed. I have shown, as far as I was able, the laws and the manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the American democracy. Here I might stop; but the reader would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perhaps feel that I had not satisfied his expectations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America; the inhabitants of the New World may be considered from more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than one point of view. In the course of this work my subject has often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,led me to speak of the Indians and the Negroes; but I have never been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able to stop in order to show what place these two races occupy in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,midst of the democratic people whom I was engaged in describing. I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mentioned in what spirit, and according to what laws, the Anglo-American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union was formed; but I could only glance at the dangers which menace,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for me to give a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"detailed account of its chances of duration, independently of its laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and manners. When speaking of the united republican States, I hazarded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the New World,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and when making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reigns in the Union, I was unable to inquire into the future condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Americans as a commercial people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These topics are collaterally connected with my subject without forming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a part of it; they are American without being democratic; and to portray,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,democracy has been my principal aim. It was therefore necessary to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"postpone these questions, which I now take up as the proper termination","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of my work.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union spreads from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean. On the east,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and west its limits are those of the continent itself. On the south it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upwards to the icy regions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the North. The human beings who are scattered over this space do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form, as in Europe, so many branches of the same stock. Three races,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally distinct, and, I might almost say, hostile to each other, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,discoverable amongst them at the first glance. Almost insurmountable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"barriers had been raised between them by education and by law, as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as by their origin and outward characteristics; but fortune has brought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them together on the same soil, where, although they are mixed, they do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not amalgamate, and each race fulfils its destiny apart.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Amongst these widely differing families of men, the first which attracts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attention, the superior in intelligence, in power and in enjoyment, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the white or European, the man pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the negro and the Indian. These two unhappy races have nothing in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"common; neither birth, nor features, nor language, nor habits. Their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only resemblance lies in their misfortunes. Both of them occupy an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inferior rank in the country they inhabit; both suffer from tyranny; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if their wrongs are not the same, they originate, at any rate, with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same authors.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the European is to the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,animals;--he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subdue, he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The negro of the United States has lost all remembrance of his country;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the language which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased to belong,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges. But he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remains half way between the two communities; sold by the one, repulsed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the other; finding not a spot in the universe to call by the name,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of country, except the faint image of a home which the shelter of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,master's roof affords.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasures, and his children are upon an equality with himself from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the moment of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God's mercy or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a visitation of his wrath, that man in certain states appears to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects, with a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"depraved taste, the cause of his misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own calamitous situation.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Violence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those who oppress him: his understanding is degraded to the level of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,soul.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born: nay, he may have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"himself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"property of another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the care of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thought appears to him a useless gift of Providence, and he quietly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enjoys the privileges of his debasement. If he becomes free,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independence is often felt by him to be a heavier burden than slavery;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for having learned, in the course of his life, to submit to everything","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"except reason, he is too much unacquainted with her dictates to obey","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is destitute of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to submit and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness, that while","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"servitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Oppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but its effects are different. Before the arrival of white men in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"New World, the inhabitants of North America lived quietly in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"woods, enduring the vicissitudes and practising the virtues and vices","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"common to savage nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tribes and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,life full of inexpressible sufferings.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Savage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North American Indians had lost the sentiment of attachment to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country; when their families were dispersed, their traditions obscured,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changed, and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyranny","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rendered them more disorderly and less civilized than they were before.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The moral and physical condition of these tribes continually grew,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"worse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,character of the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them, they have never been able to make them submit to the rules of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civilized society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of the Indian lies on the uttermost verge of liberty; and slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"does not produce more fatal effects upon the first, than independence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon the second. The negro has lost all property in his own person, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he cannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority is scarcely known to him; he has never bent his will to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that of any of his kind, nor learned the difference between voluntary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is unknown,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to him. To be free, with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilization has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,little power over him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amongst men who repulse him; he conforms to the tastes of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"oppressors, adopts their opinions, and hopes by imitating them to form a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,part of their community. Having been told from infancy that his race is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally inferior to that of the whites, he assents to the proposition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and is ashamed of his own nature. In each of his features he discovers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a trace of slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would willingly rid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,himself of everything that makes him what he is.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these dreams of pride. Far from desiring to conform his habits to ours,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he loves his savage life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"repels every advance to civilization, less perhaps from the hatred which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he entertains for it, than from a dread of resembling the Europeans.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*a While he has nothing to oppose to our perfection in the arts but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but undisciplined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,courage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by the spontaneous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"instincts of savage life, who can wonder if he fails in this unequal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contest?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: The native of North America retains his opinions and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most insignificant of his habits with a degree of tenacity which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no parallel in history. For more than two hundred years the wandering,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tribes of North America have had daily intercourse with the whites, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they have never derived from them either a custom or an idea. Yet the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europeans have exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have made them more licentious, but not more European. In the summer of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green Bay,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Indians on the north-western side. Here I became acquainted with an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact:--""I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formerly knew a young Indian,"" said he, ""who had been educated at a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"college in New England, where he had greatly distinguished himself, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,had acquired the external appearance of a member of civilized society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the war broke out between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"me--see here!' And I actually beheld,"" said the Major, ""between his body","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"dooms him to slavery, the pride of the other to death.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cover the State of Alabama, I arrived one day at the log house of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pioneer. I did not wish to penetrate into the dwelling of the American,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was not far off, in the woods. While I was in this place (which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the neighborhood of the Creek territory), an Indian woman appeared,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"followed by a negress, and holding by the hand a little white girl of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"five or six years old, whom I took to be the daughter of the pioneer.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the Indian; rings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and I saw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that she was not married, for she still wore that necklace of shells","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was clad in squalid European garments. They all three came and seated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the young Indian, taking","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,give; while the negress endeavored by various little artifices to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attract the attention of the young Creole.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The child displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,superiority which formed a strange contrast with her infantine weakness;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as if she received the attentions of her companions with a sort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condescension. The negress was seated on the ground before her mistress,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"watching her smallest desires, and apparently divided between strong","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affection for the child and servile fear; whilst the savage displayed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom and of pride which was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"almost ferocious. I had approached the group, and I contemplated them in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"silence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the Indian woman,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and giving","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,me an angry look plunged into the thicket. I had often chanced to see,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"disappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"clothes consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with food.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North America fire-arms,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ardent spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stuffs, the rough garments which had previously satisfied their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"untutored simplicity. Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which they could be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have recourse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the workmanship of the whites; but in return for their productions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the savage had nothing to offer except the rich furs which still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abounded in his woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not merely to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provide for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of barter which he could furnish to Europe. *c Whilst the wants of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"natives were thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"[Footnote c: Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"February 4, 1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus:--""The time when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Indians generally could supply themselves with food and clothing,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without any of the articles of civilized life, has long since passed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"away. The more remote tribes, beyond the Mississippi, who live where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,immense herds of buffalo are yet to be found and who follow those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"animals in their periodical migrations, could more easily than any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others recur to the habits of their ancestors, and live without the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,white man or any of his manufactures. But the buffalo is constantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"receding. The smaller animals, the bear, the deer, the beaver, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"otter, the muskrat, etc., principally minister to the comfort and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"support of the Indians; and these cannot be taken without guns,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ammunition, and traps. Among the Northwestern Indians particularly, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,labor of supplying a family with food is excessive. Day after day is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spent by the hunter without success, and during this interval his family","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must subsist upon bark or roots, or perish. Want and misery are around","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"The Indians will not live as Europeans live, and yet they can neither","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsist without them, nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This is demonstrated by a fact which I likewise give upon official,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority. Some Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,killed a European; the American government interdicted all traffic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the tribe to which the guilty parties belonged, until they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,delivered up to justice. This measure had the desired effect.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,From the moment when a European settlement is formed in the neighborhood,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the territory occupied by the Indians, the beasts of chase take the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"alarm. *d Thousands of savages, wandering in the forests and destitute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continuous sounds of European labor are heard in their neighborhood,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they begin to flee away, and retire to the West, where their instinct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"teaches them that they will find deserts of immeasurable extent. ""The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"buffalo is constantly receding,"" say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Report of the year 1829; ""a few years since they approached the base","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Alleghany; and a few years hence they may even be rare upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immense plains which extend to the base of the Rocky Mountains."" I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been assured that this effect of the approach of the whites is often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,felt at two hundred leagues' distance from their frontier. Their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence is thus exerted over tribes whose name is unknown to them; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,who suffer the evils of usurpation long before they are acquainted with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"No. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is there shown that the tribes in the centre","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"is done without difficulty, as the territory of a hunting-nation is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ill-defined; it is the common property of the tribe, and belongs to no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"previously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsist, and still more difficult to procure the articles of barter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they stand in need of.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"To drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"barrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl through","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it has ceased to yield anything but misery and death. At length they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are compelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they follow the traces of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these wild animals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the choice of their future country. Properly speaking, therefore, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is not the Europeans who drive away the native inhabitants of America;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is famine which compels them to recede; a happy distinction which had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"escaped the casuists of former times, and for which we are indebted to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,modern discovery!,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,exhausted and reduced; and the countries to which the newcomers betake,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hostility. Hunger is in the rear; war awaits them, and misery besets","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,hoped to find an asylum which had been promised them by the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was unusually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families with them;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with children","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"newly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. I saw them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"embark to pass the mighty river, and never will that solemn spectacle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was heard amongst the assembled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crowd; all were silent. Their calamities were of ancient date, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,knew them to be irremediable. The Indians had all stepped into the bark,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which was to carry them across, but their dogs remained upon the bank.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As soon as these animals perceived that their masters were finally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all together","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after the boat.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"day, in a regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. When the European","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population begins to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"savage tribe, the government of the United States usually dispatches","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"envoys to them, who assemble the Indians in a large plain, and having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first eaten and drunk with them, accost them in the following manner:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""What have you to do in the land of your fathers? Before long, you must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dig up their bones in order to live. In what respect is the country you,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabit better than another? Are there no woods, marshes, or prairies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,except where you dwell? And can you live nowhere but under your own sun?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Beyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the lake","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"beasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your lands to us,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and go to live happily in those solitudes."" After holding this language,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they spread before the eyes of the Indians firearms, woollen garments,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"kegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"looking-glasses. *g If, when they have beheld all these riches, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"still hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the means of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"refusing their required consent, and that the government itself will not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,long have the power of protecting them in their rights. What are they to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"do? Half convinced, and half compelled, they go to inhabit new deserts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,where the importunate whites will not let them remain ten years in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tranquillity. In this manner do the Americans obtain, at a very low","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"certainly it is more agreeable to the forms of justice, as well as more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"the chase. Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of abode;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but they follow a regular order in their migrations, and often return","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"again to their old stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter varies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,these endeavors were crowned by any lasting success. Civilization began,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the cabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods. The great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,error of these legislators of the Indians was their not understanding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that, in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it is first necessary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,soil; the Indians ought in the first place to have been accustomed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to agriculture. But not only are they destitute of this indispensable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"preliminary to civilization, they would even have great difficulty in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,However strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"amongst others the Cherokees and the Creeks, *n were surrounded by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europeans, who had landed on the shores of the Atlantic; and who,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"either descending the Ohio or proceeding up the Mississippi, arrived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"from place to place, like their Northern brethren; but they have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gradually enclosed within narrow limits, like the game within the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"who were thus placed between civilization and death, found themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliged to live by ignominious labor like the whites. They took to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"War of Independence. Many Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote q: Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influential in North America than in any other country. The American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continent was peopled by two great nations of Europe, the French and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the English. The former were not slow in connecting themselves with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"daughters of the natives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Indian character and their own: instead of giving the tastes and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habits of civilized life to the savages, the French too often grew","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found them in. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"became the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,friendship of the Indian by exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"de Senonville, the governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV in 1685:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""It has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ought to draw them nearer to us. But there is every reason to suppose we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have been mistaken. Those which have been brought into contact with us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have not become French, and the French who have lived among them are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changed into savages, affecting to dress and live like them."" (""History","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of New France,"" by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, continuing obstinately attached to the customs and the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insignificant habits of his forefathers, has remained in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the American solitudes just what he was in the bosom of European cities;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he would not allow of any communication with savages whom he despised,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and avoided with care the union of his race with theirs. Thus while the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"French exercised no salutary influence over the Indians, the English","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have always remained alien from them.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficulty which the Indians find in submitting to civilization proceeds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for them to escape. An attentive survey of history demonstrates that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in general, barbarous nations have raised themselves to civilization by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"degrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever they derive knowledge from a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign people, they stood towards it in the relation of conquerors, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not of a conquered nation. When the conquered nation is enlightened, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the conquerors are half savage, as in the case of the invasion of Rome","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the Northern nations or that of China by the Mongols, the power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which victory bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient to keep up his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"importance among civilized men, and permit him to rank as their equal,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"until he becomes their rival: the one has might on his side, the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has intelligence; the former admires the knowledge and the arts of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conquered, the latter envies the power of the conquerors. The barbarians","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at length admit civilized man into their palaces, and he in turn opens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his schools to the barbarians. But when the side on which the physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"force lies, also possesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"party seldom become civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore be said, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seek knowledge, but that they do not receive it when it comes to them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"summon up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possibly succeed. Superior already to the barbarous nations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surround them, they would gradually gain strength and experience, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when the Europeans should appear upon their borders, they would be in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"state, if not to maintain their independence, at least to assert their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"right to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with the conquerors.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But it is the misfortune of Indians to be brought into contact with a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilized people, which is also (it must be owned) the most avaricious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation on the globe, whilst they are still semi-barbarian: to find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of oppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Indian was destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"anyone; as soon, however, as he desires to penetrate into the social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"scale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in society, for he enters,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ignorant and poor, within the pale of science and wealth. After having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"led a life of agitation, beset with evils and dangers, but at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same time filled with proud emotions, *r he is obliged to submit to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the bread which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,results of which civilization can boast: and even this much he is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sure to obtain.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote r: There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,solitudes of Canada. Hunger and cold pursue them; every day their life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is in jeopardy. Amongst these men, manners have lost their empire,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traditions are without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shared in all these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was not kept away from the whites by force; on the contrary, he came","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every year to trade with them, entered their dwellings, and witnessed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their enjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,life he was perfectly able to do so--and he remained thirty years in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,deserts. When he came into civilized society he declared that the rude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence which he described, had a secret charm for him which he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was unable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed among,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the whites, several of his children refused to share his tranquil and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,easy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake Superior;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized being. His,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"book is written without either taste or order; but he gives, even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices, the passions, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vices, and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"till the earth like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very formidable competition. The white man is skilled in the craft of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,agriculture; the Indian is a rough beginner in an art with which he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unacquainted. The former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,latter meets with a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,earth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The European is placed amongst a population whose wants he knows and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"partakes. The savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whose manners, language, and laws he is imperfectly acquainted, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without whose assistance he cannot live. He can only procure the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,materials of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the European, for the assistance of his countrymen is wholly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes to sell the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"produce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European readily finds a market; and the former can only produce at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,considerable cost that which the latter vends at a very low rate. Thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civilized communities; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own wilderness.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,He has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive within him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods, painfully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excite his troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be less keen, his former perils less appalling. He contrasts the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,independence which he possessed amongst his equals with the servile,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"position which he occupies in civilized society. On the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the solitudes which were so long his free home are still at hand; a few,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hours' march will bring him back to them once more. The whites offer him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the ground which he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has begun to clear. This money of the Europeans may possibly furnish him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter regions;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wilderness forever. *s The condition of the Creeks and Cherokees, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which I have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates the truth of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this deplorable picture.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote s: The destructive influence of highly civilized nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon others which are less so, has been exemplified by the Europeans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves. About a century ago the French founded the town of Vincennes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up on the Wabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in great plenty until the arrival of the American settlers, who first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ruined the previous inhabitants by their competition, and afterwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purchased their lands at a very low rate. At the time when M. de Volney,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from whom I borrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the French was reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,about to pass over to Louisiana or to Canada. These French settlers were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"worthy people, but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the habits of savages. The Americans, who were perhaps their inferiors,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a moral point of view, were immeasurably superior to them in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intelligence: they were industrious, well informed, rich, and accustomed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to govern their own community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"two races is less striking, that the English are the masters of commerce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and manufacture in the Canadian country, that they spread on all sides,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and confine the French within limits which scarcely suffice to contain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them. In like manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manufacture centres in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of Texas is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"part of Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between that country and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States. In the course of the last few years the Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purchase land, they produce the commodities of the country, and supplant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the original population. It may easily be foreseen that if Mexico takes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no steps to check this change, the province of Texas will very shortly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cease to belong to that government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If the different degrees--comparatively so slight--which exist,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in European civilization produce results of such magnitude, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences which must ensue from the collision of the most perfect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European civilization with Indian savages may readily be conceived.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,displayed as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"important designs; but nations as well as men require time to learn,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whatever may be their intelligence and their zeal. Whilst the savages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were engaged in the work of civilization, the Europeans continued to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surround them on every side, and to confine them within narrower limits;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the two races gradually met, and they are now in immediate juxtaposition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to each other. The Indian is already superior to his barbarous parent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but he is still very far below his white neighbor. With their resources,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and acquired knowledge, the Europeans soon appropriated to themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most of the advantages which the natives might have derived from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possession of the soil; they have settled in the country, they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purchased land at a very low rate or have occupied it by force, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Indians have been ruined by a competition which they had not the means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of resisting. They were isolated in their own country, and their race","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only constituted a colony of troublesome aliens in the midst of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,numerous and domineering people. *t,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote t: See in the Legislative Documents (21st Congress, No. 89)","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,instances of excesses of every kind committed by the whites upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"territory of the Indians, either in taking possession of a part of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lands, until compelled to retire by the troops of Congress, or carrying","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"off their cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"doing violence to their persons. It appears, nevertheless, from all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these documents that the claims of the natives are constantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protected by the government from the abuse of force. The Union has a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representative agent continually employed to reside among the Indians;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the report of the Cherokee agent, which is among the documents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have referred to, is almost always favorable to the Indians. ""The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intrusion of whites,"" he says, ""upon the lands of the Cherokees would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cause ruin to the poor, helpless, and inoffensive inhabitants."" And he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Cherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the whites, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entirely upon ex parte evidence of their several rights, was of no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,validity whatever.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Washington said in one of his messages to Congress, ""We are more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enlightened and more powerful than the Indian nations, we are therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bound in honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But this virtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rapacity of the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government. Although the Cherokees and the Creeks are established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the territory which they inhabited before the settlement of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europeans, and although the Americans have frequently treated with them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as with foreign nations, the surrounding States have not consented to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acknowledge them as independent peoples, and attempts have been made to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subject these children of the woods to Anglo-American magistrates, laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and customs. *u Destitution had driven these unfortunate Indians to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, and oppression now drives them back to their former","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"have we committed, whereby we must forever be divested of our country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of the aborigines of North America, their calamities appear to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"irremediable: if they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire; if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they attempt to civilize their manners, the contact of a more civilized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in some measure interwoven,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with that of the Europeans. These two races are attached to each other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to separate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or to combine. The most formidable of all the ills which threaten,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the future existence of the Union arises from the presence of a black,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population upon its territory; and in contemplating the cause of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"present embarrassments or of the future dangers of the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the observer is invariably led to consider this as a primary fact.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the vehement or the increasing efforts of men; but there is one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"calamity which penetrated furtively into the world, and which was at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first scarcely distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses of power; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,originated with an individual whose name history has not preserved; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was wafted like some accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"afterwards nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with the society to which it belongs. I need scarcely add that this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"calamity is slavery. Christianity suppressed slavery, but the Christians","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the sixteenth century re-established it--as an exception, indeed, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their social system, and restricted to one of the races of mankind; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less extensive, was at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same time rendered far more difficult of cure.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and its consequences. The immediate evils which are produced by slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were very nearly the same in antiquity as they are amongst the moderns;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but the consequences of these evils were different. The slave, amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ancients, belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the superior of the two in education *d and instruction. Freedom was the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only distinction between them; and when freedom was conferred they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"easily confounded together. The ancients, then, had a very simple","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"means of avoiding slavery and its evil consequences, which was that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"measure generally. Not but, in ancient States, the vestiges of servitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subsisted for some time after servitude itself was abolished. There is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever has been their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inferior long after he is become their equal; and the real inequality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is produced by fortune or by law is always succeeded by an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nevertheless, this secondary consequence of slavery was limited to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"certain term amongst the ancients, for the freedman bore so entire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a resemblance to those born free, that it soon became impossible to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinguish him from amongst them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: It is well known that several of the most distinguished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authors of antiquity, and amongst them Aesop and Terence, were, or had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been slaves. Slaves were not always taken from barbarous nations, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the chances of war reduced highly civilized men to servitude.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amongst the moderns it is that of altering the manners; and, as far as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"we are concerned, the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"left off. This arises from the circumstance that, amongst the moderns,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the abstract and transient fact of slavery is fatally united to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,physical and permanent fact of color. The tradition of slavery dishonors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the race, and the peculiarity of the race perpetuates the tradition of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated to the shores of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"New World; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks who are now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be found in that hemisphere are either slaves or freedmen. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and although the law may abolish slavery, God alone can obliterate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traces of its existence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but in his origin. You may set the negro free, but you cannot make him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,otherwise than an alien to the European. Nor is this all; we scarcely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acknowledge the common features of mankind in this child of debasement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whom slavery has brought amongst us. His physiognomy is to our eyes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hideous, his understanding weak, his tastes low; and we are almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between man and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"brutes. *e The moderns, then, after they have abolished slavery, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"three prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to attack and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,far less easy to conquer than the mere fact of servitude: the prejudice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote e: To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conceived of the moral and intellectual inferiority of their former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slaves, the negroes must change; but as long as this opinion subsists,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to change is impossible.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"men like ourselves by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European in America. But we may derive some faint notion of them from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,analogy. France was formerly a country in which numerous distinctions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rank existed, that had been created by the legislation. Nothing can be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more fictitious than a purely legal inferiority; nothing more contrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the instinct of mankind than these permanent divisions which had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been established between beings evidently similar. Nevertheless these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,divisions subsisted for ages; they still subsist in many places; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which time alone can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,efface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"originates in the law, how are those distinctions to be destroyed which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seem to be based upon the immutable laws of Nature herself? When I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic bodies, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whatever nature they may be, are commingled with the mass of the people;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the exceeding care which they take to preserve the ideal boundaries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of their caste inviolate, I despair of seeing an aristocracy disappear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which is founded upon visible and indelible signs. Those who hope that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Europeans will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me to delude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"themselves; and I am not led to any such conclusion by my own reason, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the evidence of facts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Hitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintained the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the negroes have been strongest they have destroyed the whites; such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has been the only retribution which has ever taken place between the two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,races.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I see that in a certain portion of the territory of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at the present day, the legal barrier which separated the two races is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tending to fall away, but not that which exists in the manners of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country; slavery recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remains stationary. Whosoever has inhabited the United States must have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived that in those parts of the Union in which the negroes are no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"longer slaves, they have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites. On the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have abolished slavery, than in those where it still exists; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nowhere is it so intolerant as in those States where servitude has never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been known.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is true, that in the North of the Union, marriages may be legally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contracted between negroes and whites; but public opinion would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"stigmatize a man who should connect himself with a negress as infamous,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and it would be difficult to meet with a single instance of such a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,union. The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost all the States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"come forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If oppressed, they may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bring an action at law, but they will find none but whites amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their judges; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,repulses them from that office. The same schools do not receive the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"child of the black and of the European. In the theatres, gold cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,procure a seat for the servile race beside their former masters; in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hospitals they lie apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same Divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their own churches, with their own clergy. The gates of Heaven are not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,closed against these unhappy beings; but their inferiority is continued,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the very confines of the other world; when the negro is defunct, his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"bones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails even in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the equality of death. The negro is free, but he can share neither the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,him upon fair terms in life or in death.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,kept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whites; the whites consent to intermix with them to a certain extent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and although the legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people are more tolerant and compassionate. In the South the master is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not afraid to raise his slave to his own standing, because he knows that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he can in a moment reduce him to the dust at pleasure. In the North the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,white no longer distinctly perceives the barrier which separates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"him from the degraded race, and he shuns the negro with the more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pertinacity, since he fears lest they should some day be confounded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,together.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Amongst the Americans of the South, nature sometimes reasserts her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, and restores a transient equality between the blacks and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whites; but in the North pride restrains the most imperious of human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions. The American of the Northern States would perhaps allow the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negress to share his licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,did not declare that she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bed; but he recoils with horror from her who might become his wife.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inequality is sanctioned by the manners whilst it is effaced from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,laws of the country. But if the relative position of the two races which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabit the United States is such as I have described, it may be asked","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"why the Americans have abolished slavery in the North of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"why they maintain it in the South, and why they aggravate its hardships","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there? The answer is easily given. It is not for the good of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to abolish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"A century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,when the attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact, that the provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increased in population, in wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those which contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"however, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or by hired laborers; in the latter they were furnished with hands for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they paid no wages; yet although labor and expenses were on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the one side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,possession of the most advantageous system. This consequence seemed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be the more difficult to explain, since the settlers, who all belonged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the same European race, had the same habits, the same civilization,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely slight.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Time, however, continued to advance, and the Anglo-Americans, spreading","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"beyond the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, penetrated farther and farther","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,into the solitudes of the West; they met with a new soil and an unwonted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,climate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most various,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"character; their races intermingled, the inhabitants of the South went","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"up towards the North, those of the North descended to the South; but in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the midst of all these causes, the same result occurred at every step,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and in general, the colonies in which there were no slaves became more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,populous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished. The more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"progress was made, the more was it shown that slavery, which is so cruel","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,But this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilization,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reached the banks of the Ohio. The stream which the Indians had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinguished by the name of Ohio, or Beautiful River, waters one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the most magnificent valleys that has ever been made the abode of man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Undulating lands extend upon both shores of the Ohio, whose soil affords","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inexhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wholesome and the climate mild, and each of them forms the extreme","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,frontier of a vast State: That which follows the numerous windings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Ohio upon the left is called Kentucky, that upon the right bears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the name of the river. These two States only differ in a single respect;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Kentucky has admitted slavery, but the State of Ohio has prohibited the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of slaves within its borders. *h,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote h: Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free negroes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are allowed to enter the territory of that State, or to hold property in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it. See the Statutes of Ohio.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio to the spot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"where that river falls into the Mississippi, may be said to sail between","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberty and servitude; and a transient inspection of the surrounding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,objects will convince him as to which of the two is most favorable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mankind. Upon the left bank of the stream the population is rare; from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time to time one descries a troop of slaves loitering in the half-desert,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fields; the primaeval forest recurs at every turn; society seems to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"asleep, man to be idle, and nature alone offers a scene of activity and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of life. From the right bank, on the contrary, a confused hum is heard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which proclaims the presence of industry; the fields are covered with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abundant harvests, the elegance of the dwellings announces the taste and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"activity of the laborer, and man appears to be in the enjoyment of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"consequences of slavery and freedom may readily be understood, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Upon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with the idea of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavery, upon the right bank it is identified with that of prosperity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and improvement; on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"honored; on the former territory no white laborers can be found, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they would be afraid of assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"latter no one is idle, for the white population extends its activity and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its intelligence to every kind of employment. Thus the men whose task,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is to cultivate the rich soil of Kentucky are ignorant and lukewarm;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"over into the State of Ohio, where they may work without dishonor.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is true that in Kentucky the planters are not obliged to pay wages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the slaves whom they employ; but they derive small profits from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"labor, whilst the wages paid to free workmen would be returned with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interest in the value of their services. The free workman is paid, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he does his work quicker than the slave, and rapidity of execution is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one of the great elements of economy. The white sells his services, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are only purchased at the times at which they may be useful; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"black can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the expense of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old age as well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the productive years of youth. Payment must equally be made in order to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obtain the services of either class of men: the free workman receives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his wages in money, the slave in education, in food, in care, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,clothing. The money which a master spends in the maintenance of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slaves goes gradually and in detail, so that it is scarcely perceived;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the salary of the free workman is paid in a round sum, which appears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only to enrich the individual who receives it, but in the end the slave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has cost more than the free servant, and his labor is less productive.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*k,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote k: Independently of these causes, which, wherever free workmen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abound, render their labor more productive and more economical than that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of slaves, another cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States: the sugar-cane has hitherto been cultivated with success,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only upon the banks of the Mississippi, near the mouth of that river in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Gulf of Mexico. In Louisiana the cultivation of the sugar-cane is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exceedingly lucrative, and nowhere does a laborer earn so much by his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"work, and, as there is always a certain relation between the cost of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"production and the value of the produce, the price of slaves is very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"high in Louisiana. But Louisiana is one of the confederated States, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slaves may be carried thither from all parts of the Union; the price,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,given for slaves in New Orleans consequently raises the value of slaves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in all the other markets. The consequence of this is, that in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countries where the land is less productive, the cost of slave labor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is still very considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,competition of free labor.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The influence of slavery extends still further; it affects the character,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas and his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tastes. Upon both banks of the Ohio, the character of the inhabitants is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enterprising and energetic; but this vigor is very differently exercised,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the two States. The white inhabitant of Ohio, who is obliged to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsist by his own exertions, regards temporal prosperity as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,principal aim of his existence; and as the country which he occupies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,presents inexhaustible resources to his industry and ever-varying lures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the ordinary limits of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human cupidity: he is tormented by the desire of wealth, and he boldly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enters upon every path which fortune opens to him; he becomes a sailor,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a pioneer, an artisan, or a laborer with the same indifference, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supports, with equal constancy, the fatigues and the dangers incidental","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to these various professions; the resources of his intelligence are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"astonishing, and his avidity in the pursuit of gain amounts to a species","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of heroism.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But the Kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"labor promotes; as he lives in an idle independence, his tastes are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those of an idle man; money loses a portion of its value in his eyes;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he covets wealth much less than pleasure and excitement; and the energy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which his neighbor devotes to gain, turns with him to a passionate love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of field sports and military exercises; he delights in violent bodily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exertion, he is familiar with the use of arms, and is accustomed from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a very early age to expose his life in single combat. Thus slavery not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but even from desiring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to become so.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the last two centuries in the British colonies of North America, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have established a very striking difference between the commercial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,capacity of the inhabitants of the South and those of the North. At the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present day it is only the Northern States which are in possession,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of shipping, manufactures, railroads, and canals. This difference is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perceptible not only in comparing the North with the South, but in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,comparing the several Southern States. Almost all the individuals who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"carry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn slave labor to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"account in the most Southern districts of the Union, have emigrated from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the North. The natives of the Northern States are constantly spreading,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,over that portion of the American territory where they have less to fear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from competition; they discover resources there which escaped the notice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a system which they do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"approve, they succeed in turning it to better advantage than those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first founded and who still maintain it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Were I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost all the differences which may be remarked between the characters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Americans in the Southern and in the Northern States have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"originated in slavery; but this would divert me from my subject, and my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"present intention is not to point out all the consequences of servitude,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but those effects which it has produced upon the prosperity of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,countries which have admitted it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The influence of slavery upon the production of wealth must have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very imperfectly known in antiquity, as slavery then obtained throughout","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the civilized world; and the nations which were unacquainted with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it were barbarous. And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by advocating the claims of the slave; at the present time it may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attacked in the name of the master, and, upon this point, interest is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reconciled with morality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As these truths became apparent in the United States, slavery receded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before the progress of experience. Servitude had begun in the South, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had thence spread towards the North; but it now retires again. Freedom,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which started from the North, now descends uninterruptedly towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the South. Amongst the great States, Pennsylvania now constitutes the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extreme limit of slavery to the North: but even within those limits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the slave system is shaken: Maryland, which is immediately below","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Pennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and Virginia, which comes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"next to Maryland, is already discussing its utility and its dangers. *l","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote l: A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,last-mentioned States from the cause of slavery. The former wealth of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this part of the Union was principally derived from the cultivation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tobacco. This cultivation is specially carried on by slaves; but within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the last few years the market-price of tobacco has diminished, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the value of the slaves remains the same. Thus the ratio between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cost of production and the value of the produce is changed. The natives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Maryland and Virginia are therefore more disposed than they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thirty years ago, to give up slave labor in the cultivation of tobacco,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or to give up slavery and tobacco at the same time.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,No great change takes place in human institutions without involving,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,amongst its causes the law of inheritance. When the law of primogeniture,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obtained in the South, each family was represented by a wealthy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual, who was neither compelled nor induced to labor; and he was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"surrounded, as by parasitic plants, by the other members of his family","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who were then excluded by law from sharing the common inheritance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and who led the same kind of life as himself. The very same thing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,then occurred in all the families of the South as still happens in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wealthy families of some countries in Europe, namely, that the younger","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sons remain in the same state of idleness as their elder brother,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,without being as rich as he is. This identical result seems to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,produced in Europe and in America by wholly analogous causes. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the South of the United States the whole race of whites formed an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aristocratic body, which was headed by a certain number of privileged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals, whose wealth was permanent, and whose leisure was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hereditary. These leaders of the American nobility kept alive the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,traditional prejudices of the white race in the body of which they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the representatives, and maintained the honor of inactive life. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aristocracy contained many who were poor, but none who would work; its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"members preferred want to labor, consequently no competition was set on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foot against negro laborers and slaves, and, whatever opinion might be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entertained as to the utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"employ them, since there was no one else to work.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,No sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than fortunes began,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to diminish, and all the families of the country were simultaneously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reduced to a state in which labor became necessary to procure the means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of subsistence: several of them have since entirely disappeared, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all of them learned to look forward to the time at which it would be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessary for everyone to provide for his own wants. Wealthy individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are still to be met with, but they no longer constitute a compact and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hereditary body, nor have they been able to adopt a line of conduct in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which they could persevere, and which they could infuse into all ranks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of society. The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the first place,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abandoned by common consent; the number of needy men was increased, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence without blushing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for their exertions. Thus one of the most immediate consequences of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,partible quality of estates has been to create a class of free laborers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As soon as a competition was set on foot between the free laborer and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the slave, the inferiority of the latter became manifest, and slavery","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was attacked in its fundamental principle, which is the interest of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,master.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As slavery recedes, the black population follows its retrograde course,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and returns with it towards those tropical regions from which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,originally came. However singular this fact may at first appear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be, it may readily be explained. Although the Americans abolish the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principle of slavery, they do not set their slaves free. To illustrate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this remark, I will quote the example of the State of New York. In 1788,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the State of New York prohibited the sale of slaves within its limits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which was an indirect method of prohibiting the importation of blacks.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Thenceforward the number of negroes could only increase according to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the ratio of the natural increase of population. But eight years later,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a more decisive measure was taken, and it was enacted that all children","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"born of slave parents after July 4, 1799, should be free. No increase","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"could then take place, and although slaves still existed, slavery might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be said to be abolished.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,From the time at which a Northern State prohibited the importation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slaves, no slaves were brought from the South to be sold in its markets.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, as the sale of slaves was forbidden in that State,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an owner was no longer able to get rid of his slave (who thus became a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,burdensome possession) otherwise than by transporting him to the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But when a Northern State declared that the son of the slave should be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"born free, the slave lost a large portion of his market value, since his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"posterity was no longer included in the bargain, and the owner had then","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a strong interest in transporting him to the South. Thus the same law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevents the slaves of the South from coming to the Northern States, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,drives those of the North to the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The want of free hands is felt in a State in proportion as the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slaves decreases. But in proportion as labor is performed by free hands,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slave labor becomes less productive; and the slave is then a useless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or onerous possession, whom it is important to export to those Southern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States where the same competition is not to be feared. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abolition of slavery does not set the slave free, but it merely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"transfers him from one master to another, and from the North to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of slavery,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"do not, indeed, migrate from the North to the South; but their situation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with regard to the Europeans is not unlike that of the aborigines of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America; they remain half civilized, and deprived of their rights in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the midst of a population which is far superior to them in wealth and in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,knowledge; where they are exposed to the tyranny of the laws *m and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intolerance of the people. On some accounts they are still more to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pitied than the Indians, since they are haunted by the reminiscence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a single portion of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"soil: many of them perish miserably, *n and the rest congregate in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"great towns, where they perform the meanest offices, and lead a wretched","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and precarious existence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote m: The States in which slavery is abolished usually do what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they can to render their territory disagreeable to the negroes as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a place of residence; and as a kind of emulation exists between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different States in this respect, the unhappy blacks can only choose the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,least of the evils which beset them.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote n: There is a very great difference between the mortality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the blacks and of the whites in the States in which slavery is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abolished; from 1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the white population died in Philadelphia; but one negro out of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,twenty-one individuals of the black population died in the same space of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time. The mortality is by no means so great amongst the negroes who are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"still slaves. (See Emerson's ""Medical Statistics,"" p. 28.)]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when they were still in a state of slavery, as the number of whites","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"augments with twofold rapidity since the abolition of slavery, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"blacks would soon be, as it were, lost in the midst of a strange","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,A district which is cultivated by slaves is in general more scantily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peopled than a district cultivated by free labor: moreover, America is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"still a new country, and a State is therefore not half peopled at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time when it abolishes slavery. No sooner is an end put to slavery than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the want of free labor is felt, and a crowd of enterprising adventurers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immediately arrive from all parts of the country, who hasten to profit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the fresh resources which are then opened to industry. The soil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is soon divided amongst them, and a family of white settlers takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"possession of each tract of country. Besides which, European emigration","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is exclusively directed to the free States; for what would be the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fate of a poor emigrant who crosses the Atlantic in search of ease and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,happiness if he were to land in a country where labor is stigmatized as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,degrading?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus the white population grows by its natural increase, and at the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,time by the immense influx of emigrants; whilst the black population,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"receives no emigrants, and is upon its decline. The proportion which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existed between the two races is soon inverted. The negroes constitute a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"scanty remnant, a poor tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,an immense people in full possession of the land; and the presence of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the blacks is only marked by the injustice and the hardships of which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are the unhappy victims.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In several of the Western States the negro race never made its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appearance, and in all the Northern States it is rapidly declining. Thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great question of its future condition is confined within a narrow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circle, where it becomes less formidable, though not more easy of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,solution.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The more we descend towards the South, the more difficult does it become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to abolish slavery with advantage: and this arises from several physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,causes which it is important to point out.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The first of these causes is the climate; it is well known that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,proportion as Europeans approach the tropics they suffer more from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,labor. Many of the Americans even assert that within a certain latitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to them;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*o but I do not think that this opinion, which is so favorable to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the indolence of the inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,experience. The southern parts of the Union are not hotter than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South of Italy and of Spain; *p and it may be asked why the European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If slavery has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the destruction of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the masters, why should not the same thing take place in the Union? I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot believe that nature has prohibited the Europeans in Georgia and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Floridas, under pain of death, from raising the means of subsistence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the soil, but their labor would unquestionably be more irksome and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less productive to them than to the inhabitants of New England. As the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,free workman thus loses a portion of his superiority over the slave in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Southern States, there are fewer inducements to abolish slavery.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote o: This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rice-grounds, which are unwholesome in all countries, are particularly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dangerous in those regions which are exposed to the beams of a tropical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sun. Europeans would not find it easy to cultivate the soil in that part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the New World if it must be necessarily be made to produce rice; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may they not subsist without rice-grounds?],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote p: These States are nearer to the equator than Italy and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,lower than that of Europe.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Spanish Government formerly caused a certain number of peasants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the Acores to be transported into a district of Louisiana called,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Attakapas, by way of experiment. These settlers still cultivate the soil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"without the assistance of slaves, but their industry is so languid as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,scarcely to supply their most necessary wants.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the plants of Europe grow in the northern parts of the Union; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South has special productions of its own. It has been observed that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slave labor is a very expensive method of cultivating corn. The farmer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of corn land in a country where slavery is unknown habitually retains a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"small number of laborers in his service, and at seed-time and harvest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he hires several additional hands, who only live at his cost for a short","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,period. But the agriculturist in a slave State is obliged to keep a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"large number of slaves the whole year round, in order to sow his fields","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and to gather in his crops, although their services are only required","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for a few weeks; but slaves are unable to wait till they are hired, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to subsist by their own labor in the mean time like free laborers; in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"order to have their services they must be bought. Slavery, independently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of its general disadvantages, is therefore still more inapplicable to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,countries in which corn is cultivated than to those which produce,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"crops of a different kind. The cultivation of tobacco, of cotton, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"especially of the sugar-cane, demands, on the other hand, unremitting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attention: and women and children are employed in it, whose services are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of but little use in the cultivation of wheat. Thus slavery is naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more fitted to the countries from which these productions are derived.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Tobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane are exclusively grown in the South,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they form one of the principal sources of the wealth of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. If slavery were abolished, the inhabitants of the South would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be constrained to adopt one of two alternatives: they must either change,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their system of cultivation, and then they would come into competition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the more active and more experienced inhabitants of the North; or,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if they continued to cultivate the same produce without slave labor,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they would have to support the competition of the other States of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, which might still retain their slaves. Thus, peculiar reasons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for maintaining slavery exist in the South which do not operate in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others: the South might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish slavery;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but how should it rid its territory of the black population? Slaves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and slavery are driven from the North by the same law, but this twofold","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,result cannot be hoped for in the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The arguments which I have adduced to show that slavery is more natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and more advantageous in the South than in the North, sufficiently prove","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the number of slaves must be far greater in the former districts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It was to the southern settlements that the first Africans were brought,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and it is there that the greatest number of them have always been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"imported. As we advance towards the South, the prejudice which sanctions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,idleness increases in power. In the States nearest to the tropics there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is not a single white laborer; the negroes are consequently much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more numerous in the South than in the North. And, as I have already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observed, this disproportion increases daily, since the negroes are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,transferred to one part of the Union as soon as slavery is abolished in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the other. Thus the black population augments in the South, not only by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its natural fecundity, but by the compulsory emigration of the negroes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the North; and the African race has causes of increase in the South,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very analogous to those which so powerfully accelerate the growth of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European race in the North.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the State of Maine there is one negro in 300 inhabitants; in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Massachusetts, one in 100; in New York, two in 100; in Pennsylvania,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"three in the same number; in Maryland, thirty-four; in Virginia,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forty-two; and lastly, in South Carolina *q fifty-five per cent. Such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was the proportion of the black population to the whites in the year,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"1830. But this proportion is perpetually changing, as it constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decreases in the North and augments in the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote q: We find it asserted in an American work, entitled ""Letters","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on the Colonization Society,"" by Mr. Carey, 1833, ""That for the last","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forty years the black race has increased more rapidly than the white,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,race in the State of South Carolina; and that if we take the average,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population of the five States of the South into which slaves were first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"introduced, viz., Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and Georgia, we shall find that from 1790 to 1830 the whites have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"augmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the blacks in that of 112","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to 100.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States, in 1830, the population of the two races stood as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,follows:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Slave States, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [In 1890 the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States contained a population of 54,983,890 whites, and 7,638,360","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negroes.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is evident that the most Southern States of the Union cannot abolish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavery without incurring very great dangers, which the North had no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reason to apprehend when it emancipated its black population. We,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have already shown the system by which the Northern States secure the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"transition from slavery to freedom, by keeping the present generation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in chains, and setting their descendants free; by this means the negroes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are gradually introduced into society; and whilst the men who might,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abuse their freedom are kept in a state of servitude, those who are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,emancipated may learn the art of being free before they become their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,masters. But it would be difficult to apply this method in the South. To,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"declare that all the negroes born after a certain period shall be free,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is to introduce the principle and the notion of liberty into the heart,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of slavery; the blacks whom the law thus maintains in a state of slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from which their children are delivered, are astonished at so unequal a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fate, and their astonishment is only the prelude to their impatience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and irritation. Thenceforward slavery loses, in their eyes, that kind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of moral power which it derived from time and habit; it is reduced to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a mere palpable abuse of force. The Northern States had nothing to fear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from the contrast, because in them the blacks were few in number, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the white population was very considerable. But if this faint dawn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of freedom were to show two millions of men their true position, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,oppressors would have reason to tremble. After having affranchised the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,children of their slaves the Europeans of the Southern States would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very shortly be obliged to extend the same benefit to the whole black,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part V,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the North, as I have already remarked, a twofold migration ensues","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon the abolition of slavery, or even precedes that event when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumstances have rendered it probable; the slaves quit the country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to be transported southwards; and the whites of the Northern States, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"well as the emigrants from Europe, hasten to fill up their place. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these two causes cannot operate in the same manner in the Southern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great for any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,expectation of their ever being removed from the country to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entertained; and on the other hand, the Europeans and Anglo-Americans of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the North are afraid to come to inhabit a country in which labor has not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"yet been reinstated in its rightful honors. Besides, they very justly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,look upon the States in which the proportion of the negroes equals or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exceeds that of the whites, as exposed to very great dangers; and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,refrain from turning their activity in that direction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus the inhabitants of the South would not be able, like their Northern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countrymen, to initiate the slaves gradually into a state of freedom by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abolishing slavery; they have no means of perceptibly diminishing the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"black population, and they would remain unsupported to repress its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excesses. So that in the course of a few years, a great people of free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negroes would exist in the heart of a white nation of equal size.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The same abuses of power which still maintain slavery, would then become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the source of the most alarming perils which the white population of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South might have to apprehend. At the present time the descendants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Europeans are the sole owners of the land; the absolute masters of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all labor; and the only persons who are possessed of wealth, knowledge,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and arms. The black is destitute of all these advantages, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subsists without them because he is a slave. If he were free, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obliged to provide for his own subsistence, would it be possible for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,him to remain without these things and to support life? Or would not the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very instruments of the present superiority of the white, whilst slavery","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were abolished?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As long as the negro remains a slave, he may be kept in a condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not very far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his liberty,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he cannot but acquire a degree of instruction which will enable him to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appreciate his misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. Moreover,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there exists a singular principle of relative justice which is very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,firmly implanted in the human heart. Men are much more forcibly struck,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by those inequalities which exist within the circle of the same class,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than with those which may be remarked between different classes. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more easy for them to admit slavery, than to allow several millions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of citizens to exist under a load of eternal infamy and hereditary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wretchedness. In the North the population of freed negroes feels these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hardships and resents these indignities; but its numbers and its powers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are small, whilst in the South it would be numerous and strong.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are placed upon the same territory in the situation of two alien,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"communities, it will readily be understood that there are but two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alternatives for the future; the negroes and the whites must either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wholly part or wholly mingle. I have already expressed the conviction,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which I entertain as to the latter event. *r I do not imagine that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the white and black races will ever live in any country upon an equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,footing. But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prejudices of religion, of his country, or of his race, and if this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individual is a king he may effect surprising changes in society; but a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole people cannot rise, as it were, above itself. A despot who should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subject the Americans and their former slaves to the same yoke, might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perhaps succeed in commingling their races; but as long as the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"democracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will undertake so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"population of the United States becomes, the more isolated will it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remain. *s,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote r: This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weightier than anything that I can say: thus, for instance, it is stated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the ""Memoirs of Jefferson"" (as collected by M. Conseil), ""Nothing is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more clearly written in the book of destiny than the emancipation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,blacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a state of equal freedom under the same government, so insurmountable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,they would assuredly not have passed the Slave Emancipation Bill which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the mother-country has recently imposed upon them.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have previously observed that the mixed race is the true bond of union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,between the Europeans and the Indians; just so the mulattoes are the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true means of transition between the white and the negro; so that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wherever mulattoes abound, the intermixture of the two races is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"impossible. In some parts of America, the European and the negro races","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are so crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a man who is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entirely black, or entirely white: when they are arrived at this point,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the two races may really be said to be combined; or rather to have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"absorbed in a third race, which is connected with both without being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,identical with either.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Of all the Europeans the English are those who have mixed least with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negroes. More mulattoes are to be seen in the South of the Union than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the North, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in any other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European colony: mulattoes are by no means numerous in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States; they have no force peculiar to themselves, and when quarrels","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"originating in differences of color take place, they generally side","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the whites; just as the lackeys of the great, in Europe, assume the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contemptuous airs of nobility to the lower orders.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The pride of origin, which is natural to the English, is singularly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,augmented by the personal pride which democratic liberty fosters amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Americans: the white citizen of the United States is proud of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"race, and proud of himself. But if the whites and the negroes do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intermingle in the North of the Union, how should they mix in the South?","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Can it be supposed for an instant, that an American of the Southern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, placed, as he must forever be, between the white man with all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his physical and moral superiority and the negro, will ever think of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preferring the latter? The Americans of the Southern States have two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powerful passions which will always keep them aloof; the first is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fear of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"second the dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If I were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some future,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"time, I should say, that the abolition of slavery in the South will,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the common course of things, increase the repugnance of the white","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population for the men of color. I found this opinion upon the analogous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,observation which I already had occasion to make in the North. I there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remarked that the white inhabitants of the North avoid the negroes with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increasing care, in proportion as the legal barriers of separation are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,removed by the legislature; and why should not the same result,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"take place in the South? In the North, the whites are deterred from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intermingling with the blacks by the fear of an imaginary danger; in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, where the danger would be real, I cannot imagine that the fear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be less general.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the fact is unquestionable)","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the colored population perpetually accumulates in the extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, and that it increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"if, on the other hand, it be allowed that it is impossible to foresee","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a time at which the whites and the blacks will be so intermingled as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,derive the same benefits from society; must it not be inferred that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"blacks and the whites will, sooner or later, come to open strife in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Southern States of the Union? But if it be asked what the issue of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"struggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood that we are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,here left to form a very vague surmise of the truth. The human mind may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"succeed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and circumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"every picture of the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"understanding cannot penetrate. It appears, however, to be extremely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,probable that in the West Indian Islands the white race is destined to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be subdued, and the black population to share the same fate upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,continent.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the West India Islands the white planters are surrounded by an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"immense black population; on the continent, the blacks are placed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"between the ocean and an innumerable people, which already extends over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them in a dense mass, from the icy confines of Canada to the frontiers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Virginia, and from the banks of the Missouri to the shores of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Atlantic. If the white citizens of North America remain united, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the destruction with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the sword.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the black population which is accumulated along the coast of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Gulf of Mexico, has a chance of success if the American Union is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dissolved when the struggle between the two races begins. If the federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tie were broken, the citizens of the South would be wrong to rely upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,any lasting succor from their Northern countrymen. The latter are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,well aware that the danger can never reach them; and unless they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constrained to march to the assistance of the South by a positive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,insufficient to stimulate their exertions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Yet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, even if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the lists with an immense superiority of knowledge and of the means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,warfare; but the blacks will have numerical strength and the energy of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"despair upon their side, and these are powerful resources to men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have taken up arms. The fate of the white population of the Southern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States will, perhaps, be similar to that of the Moors in Spain. After","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"having occupied the land for centuries, it will perhaps be forced to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"retire to the country whence its ancestors came, and to abandon to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negroes the possession of a territory, which Providence seems to have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it more easily that the whites.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Southern States of the Union--a danger which, however remote it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be, is inevitable--perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The inhabitants of the North make it a common topic of conversation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,although they have no direct injury to fear from the struggle; but they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they foresee. In the Southern States the subject is not discussed: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,planter does not allude to the future in conversing with strangers; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,citizen does not communicate his apprehensions to his friends; he seeks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to conceal them from himself; but there is something more alarming in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the tacit forebodings of the South, than in the clamorous fears of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Northern States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is but little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a portion of the human race. From apprehension of the dangers which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have just been describing, a certain number of American citizens have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed a society for the purpose of exporting to the coast of Guinea,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at their own expense, such free negroes as may be willing to escape from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the oppression to which they are subject. *t In 1820, the society to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which I allude formed a settlement in Africa, upon the seventh degree","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of north latitude, which bears the name of Liberia. The most recent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"intelligence informs us that 2,500 negroes are collected there; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have introduced the democratic institutions of America into the country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their forefathers; and Liberia has a representative system of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, negro jurymen, negro magistrates, and negro priests;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"churches have been built, newspapers established, and, by a singular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"change in the vicissitudes of the world, white men are prohibited from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sojourning within the settlement. *u,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"States, and that if the negroes, like the Indians, were brought into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"collision with a people more enlightened than themselves, they would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,destroyed before they could be civilized.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred years have now,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,elapsed since the inhabitants of Europe undertook to tear the negro,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from his family and his home, in order to transport him to the shores of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"North America; at the present day, the European settlers are engaged in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sending back the descendants of those very negroes to the Continent from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which they were originally taken; and the barbarous Africans have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"brought into contact with civilization in the midst of bondage, and have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,become acquainted with free political institutions in slavery. Up to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present time Africa has been closed against the arts and sciences of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps penetrate into those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"regions, now that they are introduced by Africans themselves. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,settlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty and a most fruitful idea;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"but whatever may be its results with regard to the Continent of Africa,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it can afford no remedy to the New World.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In twelve years the Colonization Society has transported 2,500 negroes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to Africa; in the same space of time about 700,000 blacks were born in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States. If the colony of Liberia were so situated as to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were to supply the society with annual subsidies, *v and to transport","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the negroes to Africa in the vessels of the State, it would still be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population amongst the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,blacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon its territory within the same space of time, it would fail in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,suspending the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States. *w The negro race will never leave those shores of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continent, to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,continues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,efficient cause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"increasing with their scarcity, would soon become enormous; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States of the North would never consent to expend such great sums for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Union took possession of the slaves in the Southern States by force, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,that part of the country. Both alternatives are equally impossible.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"and 319,439 free blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which formed about","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one-fifth of the total population of the United States at that time.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am obliged to confess that I do not regard the abolition of slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as a means of warding off the struggle of the two races in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States. The negroes may long remain slaves without complaining; but if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are once raised to the level of free men, they will soon revolt at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,being deprived of all their civil rights; and as they cannot become the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equals of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as enemies.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the North everything contributed to facilitate the emancipation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the slaves; and slavery was abolished, without placing the free negroes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a position which could become formidable, since their number was too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,small for them ever to claim the exercise of their rights. But such is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not the case in the South. The question of slavery was a question of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commerce and manufacture for the slave-owners in the North; for those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the South, it is a question of life and death. God forbid that I should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seek to justify the principle of negro slavery, as has been done by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some American writers! But I only observe that all the countries which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,formerly adopted that execrable principle are not equally able to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abandon it at the present time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When I contemplate the condition of the South, I can only discover two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alternatives which may be adopted by the white inhabitants of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States; viz., either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with them; or, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,slavery as long as possible. All intermediate measures seem to me likely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to terminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil wars, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perhaps in the extirpation of one or other of the two races. Such is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"view which the Americans of the South take of the question, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,act consistently with it. As they are determined not to mingle with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"negroes, they refuse to emancipate them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Not that the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as necessary to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wealth of the planter, for on this point many of them agree with their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Northern countrymen in freely admitting that slavery is prejudicial to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their interest; but they are convinced that, however prejudicial it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be, they hold their lives upon no other tenure. The instruction which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,now diffused in the South has convinced the inhabitants that slavery is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"injurious to the slave-owner, but it has also shown them, more clearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"than before, that no means exist of getting rid of its bad consequences.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Hence arises a singular contrast; the more the utility of slavery is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contested, the more firmly is it established in the laws; and whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the principle of servitude is gradually abolished in the North, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,self-same principle gives rise to more and more rigorous consequences in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The legislation of the Southern States with regard to slaves, presents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,at the present day such unparalleled atrocities as suffice to show how,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"radically the laws of humanity have been perverted, and to betray the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,desperate position of the community in which that legislation has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been promulgated. The Americans of this portion of the Union have not,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"indeed, augmented the hardships of slavery; they have, on the contrary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bettered the physical condition of the slaves. The only means by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the ancients maintained slavery were fetters and death; the Americans of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the South of the Union have discovered more intellectual securities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the duration of their power. They have employed their despotism and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their violence against the human mind. In antiquity, precautions were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taken to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; at the present day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures are adopted to deprive him even of the desire of freedom. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ancients kept the bodies of their slaves in bondage, but they placed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no restraint upon the mind and no check upon education; and they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"acted consistently with their established principle, since a natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"termination of slavery then existed, and one day or other the slave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"might be set free, and become the equal of his master. But the Americans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the South, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be commingled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to read or to write,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,under severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"level, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the brutes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The hope of liberty had always been allowed to the slave to cheer the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hardships of his condition. But the Americans of the South are well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"aware that emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed man can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"never be assimilated to his former master. To give a man his freedom,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and to leave him in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prepare a future chief for a revolt of the slaves. Moreover, it has long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,been remarked that the presence of a free negro vaguely agitates the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"minds of his less fortunate brethren, and conveys to them a dim notion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their rights. The Americans of the South have consequently taken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,measures to prevent slave-owners from emancipating their slaves in most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cases; not indeed by a positive prohibition, but by subjecting that step","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to various forms which it is difficult to comply with. I happened,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to meet with an old man, in the South of the Union, who had lived in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"illicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"children by her, who were born the slaves of their father. He had indeed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,frequently thought of bequeathing to them at least their liberty; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,years had elapsed without his being able to surmount the legal obstacles,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to their emancipation, and in the mean while his old age was come, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he was about to die. He pictured to himself his sons dragged from market,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to market, and passing from the authority of a parent to the rod of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the stranger, until these horrid anticipations worked his expiring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imagination into frenzy. When I saw him he was a prey to all the anguish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of despair, and he made me feel how awful is the retribution of nature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon those who have broken her laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These evils are unquestionably great; but they are the necessary and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreseen consequence of the very principle of modern slavery. When the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europeans chose their slaves from a race differing from their own, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many of them considered as inferior to the other races of mankind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and which they all repelled with horror from any notion of intimate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"connection, they must have believed that slavery would last forever;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,since there is no intermediate state which can be durable between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excessive inequality produced by servitude and the complete equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which originates in independence. The Europeans did imperfectly feel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this truth, but without acknowledging it even to themselves. Whenever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been dictated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by their interest and their pride, or by their compassion. They first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,violated every right of humanity by their treatment of the negro,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they afterwards informed him that those rights were precious and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inviolable. They affected to open their ranks to the slaves, but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,negroes who attempted to penetrate into the community were driven back,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with scorn; and they have incautiously and involuntarily been led to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"admit of freedom instead of slavery, without having the courage to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wholly iniquitous, or wholly just.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Americans of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South will mingle their blood with that of the negroes, can they allow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their slaves to become free without compromising their own security? And,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,if they are obliged to keep that race in bondage in order to save their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own families, may they not be excused for availing themselves of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means best adapted to that end? The events which are taking place in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Southern States of the Union appear to me to be at once the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,horrible and the most natural results of slavery. When I see the order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of nature overthrown, and when I hear the cry of humanity in its vain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"struggle against the laws, my indignation does not light upon the men of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,our own time who are the instruments of these outrages; but I reserve,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"my execration for those who, after a thousand years of freedom, brought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,back slavery into the world once more.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the South to maintain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slavery, they will not always succeed. Slavery, which is now confined to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a single tract of the civilized earth, which is attacked by Christianity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as unjust, and by political economy as prejudicial; and which is now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contrasted with democratic liberties and the information of our age,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cannot survive. By the choice of the master, or by the will of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"slave, it will cease; and in either case great calamities may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expected to ensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of the South,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they will in the end seize it for themselves by force; if it be given,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they will abuse it ere long. *x,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,South and decided by the results of the Civil War. But it must be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confessed that the sagacity of the author is sometimes at fault in these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speculations, and did not save him from considerable errors, which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"course of events has since made apparent. He held that ""the legislators","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Constitution of 1789 were not appointed to constitute the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government of a single people, but to regulate the association of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several States; that the Union was formed by the voluntary agreement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the States, and in uniting together they have not forfeited their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same people."" Whence he inferred that ""if one of the States chose to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"withdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its right of doing so; and that the Federal Government would have no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"means of maintaining its claims directly, either by force or by right.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This is the Southern theory of the Constitution, and the whole case of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the South in favor of secession. To many Europeans, and to some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American (Northern) jurists, this view appeared to be sound; but it was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vigorously resisted by the North, and crushed by force of arms.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The author of this book was mistaken in supposing that the ""Union was a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling."" When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the day of trial came, millions of men were ready to lay down their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lives for it. He was also mistaken in supposing that the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Executive is so weak that it requires the free consent of the governed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to enable it to subsist, and that it would be defeated in a struggle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to maintain the Union against one or more separate States. In 1861 nine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, with a population of 8,753,000, seceded, and maintained for four","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"years a resolute but unequal contest for independence, but they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,defeated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Lastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a community of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests would always prevail between North and South sufficiently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powerful to bind them together. He overlooked the influence which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question of slavery must have on the Union the moment that the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the people of the North declared against it. In 1831, when the author","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"visited America, the anti-slavery agitation had scarcely begun; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact of Southern slavery was accepted by men of all parties, even in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States where there were no slaves: and that was unquestionably the view,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,taken by all the States and by all American statesmen at the time of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"adoption of the Constitution, in 1789. But in the course of thirty years","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a great change took place, and the North refused to perpetuate what had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"become the ""peculiar institution"" of the South, especially as it gave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the South a species of aristocratic preponderance. The result was the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ratification, in December, 1865, of the celebrated 13th article or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amendment of the Constitution, which declared that ""neither slavery nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,involuntary servitude--except as a punishment for crime--shall exist,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within the United States."" To which was soon afterwards added the 15th","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"slaves without compensation, and the transfer to them of political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The maintenance of the existing institutions of the several States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,depends in some measure upon the maintenance of the Union itself. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore important in the first instance to inquire into the probable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fate of the Union. One point may indeed be assumed at once: if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the present confederation were dissolved, it appears to me to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,incontestable that the States of which it is now composed would not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"return to their original isolated condition, but that several unions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inquire into the principles upon which these new unions would probably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the dismemberment of the existing confederation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,With this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already taken, and to revert to topics which I have before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"discussed. I am aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the importance of the matter which still remains to be treated is my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"excuse; I had rather say too much, than say too little to be thoroughly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"understood, and I prefer injuring the author to slighting the subject.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The legislators who formed the Constitution of 1789 endeavored to confer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a distinct and preponderating authority upon the federal power. But they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were confined by the conditions of the task which they had undertaken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to perform. They were not appointed to constitute the government of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"single people, but to regulate the association of several States; and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whatever their inclinations might be, they could not but divide the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise of sovereignty in the end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In order to understand the consequences of this division, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessary to make a short distinction between the affairs of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government. There are some objects which are national by their very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature, that is to say, which affect the nation as a body, and can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only be intrusted to the man or the assembly of men who most completely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,represent the entire nation. Amongst these may be reckoned war and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,diplomacy. There are other objects which are provincial by their very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature, that is to say, which only affect certain localities, and which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"can only be properly treated in that locality. Such, for instance, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the budget of a municipality. Lastly, there are certain objects of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a mixed nature, which are national inasmuch as they affect all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens who compose the nation, and which are provincial inasmuch as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is not necessary that the nation itself should provide for them all.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Such are the rights which regulate the civil and political condition of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the citizens. No society can exist without civil and political rights.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,These rights therefore interest all the citizens alike; but it is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,always necessary to the existence and the prosperity of the nation that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these rights should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regulated by the central authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"There are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the direction of the sovereign power; and these categories occur in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all well-constituted communities, whatever the basis of the political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constitution may otherwise be. Between these two extremes the objects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which I have termed mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obtained by a national or by a provincial government, according to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agreement of the contracting parties, without in any way impairing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contract of association.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The sovereign power is usually formed by the union of separate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals, who compose a people; and individual powers or collective","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forces, each representing a very small portion of the sovereign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"authority, are the sole elements which are subjected to the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government of their choice. In this case the general Government is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally called upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of essential national importance, but those which are of a more local","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interest; and the local governments are reduced to that small share of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereign authority which is indispensable to their prosperity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of preorganized,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political bodies, by virtue of circumstances anterior to their union;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and in this case the provincial governments assume the control, not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of those affairs which more peculiarly belong to their province, but of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"all, or of a part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has been made.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,For the confederate nations which were independent sovereign States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before their union, and which still represent a very considerable share","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the sovereign power, have only consented to cede to the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government the exercise of those rights which are indispensable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When the national Government, independently of the prerogatives inherent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in its nature, is invested with the right of regulating the affairs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which relate partly to the general and partly to the local interests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it possesses a preponderating influence. Not only are its own rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extensive, but all the rights which it does not possess exist by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sufferance, and it may be apprehended that the provincial governments","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be deprived of their natural and necessary prerogatives by its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When, on the other hand, the provincial governments are invested","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the power of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposite tendency prevails in society. The preponderating force resides,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the province, not in the nation; and it may be apprehended that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national Government may in the end be stripped of the privileges which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are necessary to its existence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Independent nations have therefore a natural tendency to centralization,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and confederations to dismemberment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It now only remains for us to apply these general principles to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American Union. The several States were necessarily possessed of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right of regulating all exclusively provincial affairs. Moreover these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same States retained the rights of determining the civil and political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"competency of the citizens, or regulating the reciprocal relations of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the members of the community, and of dispensing justice; rights which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are of a general nature, but which do not necessarily appertain to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,national Government. We have shown that the Government of the Union is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,invested with the power of acting in the name of the whole nation in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those cases in which the nation has to appear as a single and undivided,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power; as, for instance, in foreign relations, and in offering a common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resistance to a common enemy; in short, in conducting those affairs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which I have styled exclusively national.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In this division of the rights of sovereignty, the share of the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seems at first sight to be more considerable than that of the States;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but a more attentive investigation shows it to be less so. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undertakings of the Government of the Union are more vast, but their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence is more rarely felt. Those of the provincial governments are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"comparatively small, but they are incessant, and they serve to keep","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alive the authority which they represent. The Government of the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,watches the general interests of the country; but the general interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of a people have a very questionable influence upon individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"happiness, whilst provincial interests produce a most immediate effect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the welfare of the inhabitants. The Union secures the independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"citizens; but the several States maintain the liberty, regulate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rights, protect the fortune, and secure the life and the whole future","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prosperity of every citizen.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Federal Government is very far removed from its subjects, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provincial governments are within the reach of them all, and are ready","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to attend to the smallest appeal. The central Government has upon its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,side the passions of a few superior men who aspire to conduct it; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the side of the provincial governments are the interests of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those second-rate individuals who can only hope to obtain power within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their own State, and who nevertheless exercise the largest share of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority over the people because they are placed nearest to its level.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans have therefore much more to hope and to fear from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States than from the Union; and, in conformity with the natural tendency","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the human mind, they are more likely to attach themselves to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former than to the latter. In this respect their habits and feelings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,harmonize with their interests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form of government, the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,people are for a long time at variance with their legislation; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former tend to give a degree of influence to the central government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the latter forbids. When a number of confederate states unite to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form a single nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have no doubt that if France were to become a confederate republic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like that of the United States, the government would at first display","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more energy than that of the Union; and if the Union were to alter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its constitution to a monarchy like that of France, I think that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American Government would be a long time in acquiring the force,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which now rules the latter nation. When the national existence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans began, their provincial existence was already of long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,standing; necessary relations were established between the townships and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the individual citizens of the same States; and they were accustomed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to consider some objects as common to them all, and to conduct other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affairs as exclusively relating to their own special interests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,patriotic feeling. The forms and limits of the State are distinct and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,circumscribed; since it represents a certain number of objects which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,familiar to the citizens and beloved by all. It is identified with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very soil, with the right of property and the domestic affections, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the recollections of the past, the labors of the present, and the hopes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the future. Patriotism, then, which is frequently a mere extension of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual egotism, is still directed to the State, and is not excited","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the Union. Thus the tendency of the interests, the habits, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feelings of the people is to centre political activity in the States, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is easy to estimate the different forces of the two governments, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whenever the government of a State has occasion to address an individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or an assembly of individuals, its language is clear and imperative; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,such is also the tone of the Federal Government in its intercourse with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with a State than it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"begins to parley, to explain its motives and to justify its conduct, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"argue, to advise, and, in short, anything but to command. If doubts are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"raised as to the limits of the constitutional powers of each government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the provincial government prefers its claim with boldness, and takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prompt and energetic steps to support it. In the mean while the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government of the Union reasons; it appeals to the interests, to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"good sense, to the glory of the nation; it temporizes, it negotiates,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and does not consent to act until it is reduced to the last extremity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At first sight it might readily be imagined that it is the provincial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government which is armed with the authority of the nation, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Congress represents a single State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Federal Government is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those who founded it, naturally so weak that it more peculiarly requires","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the free consent of the governed to enable it to subsist. It is easy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to perceive that its object is to enable the States to realize with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"facility their determination of remaining united; and, as long as this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"preliminary condition exists, its authority is great, temperate, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effective. The Constitution fits the Government to control individuals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and easily to surmount such obstacles as they may be inclined to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,offer; but it was by no means established with a view to the possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,separation of one or more of the States from the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that of the States at the present day, its defeat may be confidently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,predicted; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seriously undertaken. As often as a steady resistance is offered to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Government it will be found to yield. Experience has hitherto,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shown that whenever a State has demanded anything with perseverance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,thought fit. *z,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote z: See the conduct of the Northern States in the war of 1812.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""During that war,"" says Jefferson in a letter to General Lafayette,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"""four of the Eastern States were only attached to the Union, like so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many inanimate bodies to living men.""]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But even if the Government of the Union had any strength inherent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"itself, the physical situation of the country would render the exercise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of that strength very difficult. *a The United States cover an immense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,territory; they are separated from each other by great distances; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the population is disseminated over the surface of a country which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still half a wilderness. If the Union were to undertake to enforce the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"allegiance of the confederate States by military means, it would be in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a position very analogous to that of England at the time of the War of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Independence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote a: The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,standing army; and without a standing army a government is not prepared,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to profit by a favorable opportunity to conquer resistance, and take the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign power by surprise. [This note, and the paragraph in the text","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which precedes, have been shown by the results of the Civil War to be a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,misconception of the writer.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"However strong a government may be, it cannot easily escape from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences of a principle which it has once admitted as the foundation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of its constitution. The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the States; and, in uniting together, they have not forfeited their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same people. If one of the States chose to withdraw its name from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contract, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Federal Government would have no means of maintaining its claims,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"directly, either by force or by right. In order to enable the Federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Government easily to conquer the resistance which may be offered to it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by any one of its subjects, it would be necessary that one or more of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"them should be specially interested in the existence of the Union, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has frequently been the case in the history of confederations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If it be supposed that amongst the States which are united by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,federal tie there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantages of union, or whose prosperity depends on the duration of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"union, it is unquestionable that they will always be ready to support","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the central Government in enforcing the obedience of the others. But the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government would then be exerting a force not derived from itself, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from a principle contrary to its nature. States form confederations in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,order to derive equal advantages from their union; and in the case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"just alluded to, the Federal Government would derive its power from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,unequal distribution of those benefits amongst the States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If one of the confederate States have acquired a preponderance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sufficiently great to enable it to take exclusive possession of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the central authority, it will consider the other States as subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provinces, and it will cause its own supremacy to be respected under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,borrowed name of the sovereignty of the Union. Great things may then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be done in the name of the Federal Government, but in reality that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government will have ceased to exist. *b In both these cases, the power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it abandons the natural state and the acknowledged principles of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confederations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote b: Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Countries, and the Emperor in the Germanic Confederation, have sometimes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"put themselves in the place of the union, and have employed the federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,authority to their own advantage.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In America the existing Union is advantageous to all the States, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is not indispensable to any one of them. Several of them might break,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the federal tie without compromising the welfare of the others, although","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own prosperity would be lessened. As the existence and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,happiness of none of the States are wholly dependent on the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution, they would none of them be disposed to make great personal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sacrifices to maintain it. On the other hand, there is no State which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seems hitherto to have its ambition much interested in the maintenance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the existing Union. They certainly do not all exercise the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"influence in the federal councils, but no one of them can hope to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"domineer over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subjects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It appears to me unquestionable that if any portion of the Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seriously desired to separate itself from the other States, they would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not be able, nor indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the present Union will only last as long as the States which compose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it choose to continue members of the confederation. If this point be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"admitted, the question becomes less difficult; and our object is, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to inquire whether the States of the existing Union are capable of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"separating, but whether they will choose to remain united.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Amongst the various reasons which tend to render the existing Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"useful to the Americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the observer. Although the Americans are, as it were, alone upon their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"continent, their commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with which they trade. Notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans require a certain degree of strength, which they cannot retain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,otherwise than by remaining united to each other. If the States were to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"split, they would not only diminish the strength which they are now able","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to display towards foreign nations, but they would soon create foreign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powers upon their own territory. A system of inland custom-houses would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,then be established; the valleys would be divided by imaginary boundary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lines; the courses of the rivers would be confined by territorial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinctions; and a multitude of hindrances would prevent the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from exploring the whole of that vast continent which Providence has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,allotted to them for a dominion. At present they have no invasion to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fear, and consequently no standing armies to maintain, no taxes to levy.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If the Union were dissolved, all these burdensome measures might ere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,long be required. The Americans are then very powerfully interested,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the maintenance of their Union. On the other hand, it is almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible to discover any sort of material interest which might at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,present tempt a portion of the Union to separate from the other States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"When we cast our eyes upon the map of the United States, we perceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the chain of the Alleghany Mountains, running from the northeast to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"southwest, and crossing nearly one thousand miles of country; and we are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,led to imagine that the design of Providence was to raise between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,valley of the Mississippi and the coast of the Atlantic Ocean one of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those natural barriers which break the mutual intercourse of men, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,form the necessary limits of different States. But the average height of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Alleghanies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their greatest elevation is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the spacious valleys","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which they conceal within their passes, are of easy access from several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sides. Besides which, the principal rivers which fall into the Atlantic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Ocean--the Hudson, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac--take their rise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"beyond the Alleghanies, in an open district, which borders upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"valley of the Mississippi. These streams quit this tract of country,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,make their way through the barrier which would seem to turn them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"westward, and as they wind through the mountains they open an easy and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural passage to man. No natural barrier exists in the regions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are now inhabited by the Anglo-Americans; the Alleghanies are so far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from serving as a boundary to separate nations, that they do not even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"serve as a frontier to the States. New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"comprise them within their borders, and they extend as much to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,west as to the east of the line. The territory now occupied by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"twenty-four States of the Union, and the three great districts which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"have not yet acquired the rank of States, although they already contain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants, covers a surface of 1,002,600 square miles, *c which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,about equal to five times the extent of France. Within these limits the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"qualities of the soil, the temperature, and the produce of the country,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are extremely various. The vast extent of territory occupied by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Anglo-American republics has given rise to doubts as to the maintenance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their Union. Here a distinction must be made; contrary interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sometimes arise in the different provinces of a vast empire, which often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,terminate in open dissensions; and the extent of the country is then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most prejudicial to the power of the State. But if the inhabitants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these vast regions are not divided by contrary interests, the extent of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the territory may be favorable to their prosperity; for the unity of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government promotes the interchange of the different productions of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"soil, and increases their value by facilitating their consumption.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is indeed easy to discover different interests in the different parts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Union, but I am unacquainted with any which are hostile to each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other. The Southern States are almost exclusively agricultural. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Northern States are more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States of the West are at the same time agricultural and manufacturing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the South the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of cotton, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of sugar; in the North and the West, of wheat and maize. These are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,different sources of wealth; but union is the means by which these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several districts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The North, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Americans to all parts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the world, and brings back the produce of the globe to the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is evidently interested in maintaining the confederation in its present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"condition, in order that the number of American producers and consumers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may remain as large as possible. The North is the most natural agent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of communication between the South and the West of the Union on the one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"hand, and the rest of the world upon the other; the North is therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interested in the union and prosperity of the South and the West,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in order that they may continue to furnish raw materials for its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The South and the West, on their side, are still more directly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interested in the preservation of the Union, and the prosperity of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"North. The produce of the South is, for the most part, exported","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,beyond seas; the South and the West consequently stand in need of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,commercial resources of the North. They are likewise interested in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the maintenance of a powerful fleet by the Union, to protect them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"efficaciously. The South and the West have no vessels, but they cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,refuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fleets of Europe were to blockade the ports of the South and the delta,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Mississippi, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tobacco of Virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Mississippi? Every portion of the federal budget does therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contribute to the maintenance of material interests which are common to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the confederate States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Independently of this commercial utility, the South and the West of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Union derive great political advantages from their connection with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,North. The South contains an enormous slave population; a population,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is already alarming, and still more formidable for the future. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States of the West lie in the remotest parts of a single valley; and all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rivers which intersect their territory rise in the Rocky Mountains,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"or in the Alleghanies, and fall into the Mississippi, which bears them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,onwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The Western States are consequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entirely cut off, by their position, from the traditions of Europe and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the civilization of the Old World. The inhabitants of the South, then,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are induced to support the Union in order to avail themselves of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,protection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of the West in order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"not to be excluded from a free communication with the rest of the globe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and shut up in the wilds of central America. The North cannot but desire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,The inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that calculating patriotism which is founded upon interest, and which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a change in the interests at stake may obliterate. Nor do I attach much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"importance to the language of the Americans, when they manifest, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their daily conversations, the intention of maintaining the federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,system adopted by their forefathers. A government retains its sway,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"over a great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and rational","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"extent involuntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and resemblances of opinion. I will never admit that men constitute a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"social body, simply because they obey the same head and the same laws.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Society can only exist when a great number of men consider a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,number of things in the same point of view; when they hold the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions upon many subjects, and when the same occurrences suggest the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same thoughts and impressions to their minds.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The observer who examines the present condition of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon this principle, will readily discover, that although the citizens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are divided into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,constitute a single people; and he may perhaps be led to think that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state of the Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that of certain nations of Europe which live under the same legislation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the same prince.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Although the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects, they all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regard religion in the same manner. They are not always agreed upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"measures which are most conducive to good government, and they vary upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,some of the forms of government which it is expedient to adopt; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"human society. From Maine to the Floridas, and from the Missouri to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Atlantic Ocean, the people is held to be the legitimate source of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"power. The same notions are entertained respecting liberty and equality,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,responsibility of the agents of Government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,If we turn from their political and religious opinions to the moral and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,philosophical principles which regulate the daily actions of life and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"govern their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Anglo-Americans *d acknowledge the absolute moral authority of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reason of the community, as they acknowledge the political authority of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the surest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"arbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false. The majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of them believe that a man will be led to do what is just and good by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,following his own interest rightly understood. They hold that every man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is born in possession of the right of self-government, and that no one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has the right of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,have all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opinion that the effects of the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consider society as a body in a state of improvement, humanity as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"changing scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent; and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,admit that what appears to them to be good to-day may be superseded by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"something better-to-morrow. I do not give all these opinions as true,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,but I quote them as characteristic of the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"expression Anglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the nation; for a certain number of isolated individuals are of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,course to be met with holding very different opinions.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Anglo-Americans are not only united together by these common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions, but they are separated from all other nations by a common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,feeling of pride. For the last fifty years no pains have been spared to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,convince the inhabitants of the United States that they constitute the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"only religious, enlightened, and free people. They perceive that, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the present, their own democratic institutions succeed, whilst those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of other countries fail; hence they conceive an overweening opinion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of their superiority, and they are not very remote from believing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves to belong to a distinct race of mankind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The dangers which threaten the American Union do not originate in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"diversity of interests or of opinions, but in the various characters and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passions of the Americans. The men who inhabit the vast territory of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States are almost all the issue of a common stock; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"effects of the climate, and more especially of slavery, have gradually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,introduced very striking differences between the British settler of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Southern States and the British settler of the North. In Europe it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,generally believed that slavery has rendered the interests of one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,part of the Union contrary to those of another part; but I by no means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remarked this to be the case: slavery has not created interests in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South contrary to those of the North, but it has modified the character","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and changed the habits of the natives of the South.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have already explained the influence which slavery has exercised upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the commercial ability of the Americans in the South; and this same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence equally extends to their manners. The slave is a servant who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"never remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. He","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may sometimes assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,South there are no families so poor as not to have slaves. The citizen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Southern States of the Union is invested with a sort of domestic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dictatorship, from his earliest years; the first notion he acquires","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in life is that he is born to command, and the first habit which he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contracts is that of being obeyed without resistance. His education,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tends, then, to give him the character of a supercilious and a hasty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"man; irascible, violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obstacles, but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,attempt.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The American of the Northern States is surrounded by no slaves in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his childhood; he is even unattended by free servants, and is usually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliged to provide for his own wants. No sooner does he enter the world,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,than the idea of necessity assails him on every side: he soon learns,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to know exactly the natural limit of his authority; he never expects to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"subdue those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the surest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"means of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures, is to win their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"favor. He therefore becomes patient, reflecting, tolerant, slow to act,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and persevering in his designs.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,In the Southern States the more immediate wants of life are always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,supplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cares of life, which are always provided for by others; and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,imagination is diverted to more captivating and less definite objects.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The American of the South is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gayety, of pleasure, and above all of idleness; nothing obliges him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to exert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"occupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even attempt what","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be useful.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in the North,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,plunge the inhabitants in those same cares of daily life which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,disdained by the white population of the South. They are taught from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"infancy to combat want, and to place comfort above all the pleasures","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the intellect or the heart. The imagination is extinguished by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"trivial details of life, and the ideas become less numerous and less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general, but far more practical and more precise. As prosperity is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the sole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; nature and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage, and society is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst individual egotism is the source of general happiness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The citizen of the North has not only experience, but knowledge:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nevertheless he sets but little value upon the pleasures of knowledge;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"he esteems it as the means of attaining a certain end, and he is only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,anxious to seize its more lucrative applications. The citizen of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South is more given to act upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more generous, more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a greater degree of activity, of common-sense, of information, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil qualities of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies. If two men are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"united in society, who have the same interests, and to a certain extent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the same opinions, but different characters, different acquirements, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a different style of civilization, it is probable that these men will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Slavery, then, does not attack the American Union directly in its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interests, but indirectly in its manners.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,tripled in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"13,000,000. *e Changes of such magnitude cannot take place without some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,danger.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"A society of nations, as well as a society of individuals, derives its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"principal chances of duration from the wisdom of its members, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"individual weakness, and their limited number. The Americans who quit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are adventurers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,men expelled from the States in which they were born. When they arrive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the deserts they are unknown to each other, and they have neither","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"traditions, family feeling, nor the force of example to check their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excesses. The empire of the laws is feeble amongst them; that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,morality is still more powerless. The settlers who are constantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peopling the valley of the Mississippi are, then, in every respect very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inferior to the Americans who inhabit the older parts of the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,the greater are the chances of the duration of the contract; for their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"safety is then dependent upon their union. When, in 1790, the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"populous of the American republics did not contain 500,000 inhabitants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"*g each of them felt its own insignificance as an independent people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and this feeling rendered compliance with the federal authority more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"easy. But when one of the confederate States reckons, like the State of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"New York, 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"equal in surface to a quarter of France, *h it feels its own strength;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and although it may continue to support the Union as advantageous to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its prosperity, it no longer regards that body as necessary to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"existence, and as it continues to belong to the federal compact, it soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aims at preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable unanimity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the States is diminished as their number increases. At present the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"of the Union; but I am still of opinion that where there are 100,000,000","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of men, and forty distinct nations, unequally strong, the continuance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its increase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arises from the continual changes which take place in the position of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its internal strength. The distance from Lake Superior to the Gulf of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Mexico extends from the 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of more than 1,200 miles as the bird flies. The frontier of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States winds along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"within its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond it, into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,waste. It has been calculated that the whites advance every year a mean,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distance of seventeen miles along the whole of his vast boundary. *j,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Obstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake or an Indian nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing column","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and as soon as they are reunited they proceed onwards. This gradual and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,continuous progress of the European race towards the Rocky Mountains has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,sprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi; and at the present day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whole Union in 1790. Their population amounts to nearly 4,000,000. *k","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The city of Washington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union; but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Western States are already obliged to perform a journey as long as that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,All the States are borne onwards at the same time in the path of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fortune, but of course they do not all increase and prosper in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same proportion. To the North of the Union the detached branches of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Alleghany chain, which extend as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spacious roads and ports, which are constantly accessible to vessels","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the greatest burden. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Mississippi the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few harbors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which exist amongst these lagoons afford much shallower water to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vessels, and much fewer commercial advantages than those of the North.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This first natural cause of inferiority is united to another cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proceeding from the laws. We have already seen that slavery, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"abolished in the North, still exists in the South; and I have pointed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,out its fatal consequences upon the prosperity of the planter himself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The North is therefore superior to the South both in commerce *m and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manufacture; the natural consequence of which is the more rapid increase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of population and of wealth within its borders. The States situate upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the shores of the Atlantic Ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,land is held by an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so many emigrants as the Western States, where a boundless field is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,still open to their exertions. The valley of the Mississippi is far more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This reason, added to all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the others, contributes to drive the Europeans westward--a fact which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may be rigorously demonstrated by figures. It is found that the sum,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,total of the population of all the United States has about tripled in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the course of forty years. But in the recent States adjacent to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Mississippi, the population has increased thirty-one-fold, within the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same space of time. *n,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote m: The following statements will suffice to show the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difference which exists between the commerce of the South and that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the North:--,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging to Virginia,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great Southern States),","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same year the tonnage of the vessels","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the State of Massachusetts alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, 2d session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the State of Massachusetts had three times as much shipping as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,four above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the State of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its population amounts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in 1890]; whilst the area of the four","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other States I have quoted is 210,000 square miles, and their population","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"3,047,767. Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,one-thirtieth part of the area of the four States; and its population,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is five times smaller than theirs. (See ""Darby's View of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,necessary to explain how the number of representatives for a State may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"decrease, when the population of that State, far from diminishing, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"actually upon the increase. I take the State of Virginia, to which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have already alluded, as my term of comparison. The number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of Virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of Virginia was likewise proportionate to the total,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its population, augmented in the course of ten years, bore to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,augmented population of the Union in the same space of time. The new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number of Virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is to the old","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"number; and, on the other hand, as the augmentation of the population of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Virginia is to that of the whole population of the country. Thus, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,greater in an exact inverse ratio of the proportion between the new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,representatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and if the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"time at which one party is losing strength, and the other is gaining it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This rapid and disproportionate increase of certain States threatens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the independence of the others. New York might perhaps succeed, with its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty representatives, in dictating to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the other States in Congress. But even if the more powerful States make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,there is almost as much in the possibility of the act as in the act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,itself. The weak generally mistrust the justice and the reason of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strong. The States which increase less rapidly than the others look upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,those which are more favored by fortune with envy and suspicion. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,arise the deep-seated uneasiness and ill-defined agitation which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"observable in the South, and which form so striking a contrast to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confidence and prosperity which are common to other parts of the Union.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am inclined to think that the hostile measures taken by the Southern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,provinces upon a recent occasion are attributable to no other cause. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants of the Southern States are, of all the Americans, those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,assuredly suffer most from being left to themselves; and yet they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the only citizens who threaten to break the tie of confederation. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is easy to perceive that the South, which has given four Presidents,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, to the Union, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"perceives that it is losing its federal influence, and that the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of its representatives in Congress is diminishing from year to year,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,whilst those of the Northern and Western States are increasing; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South, which is peopled with ardent and irascible beings, is becoming","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more and more irritated and alarmed. The citizens reflect upon their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"present position and remember their past influence, with the melancholy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uneasiness of men who suspect oppression: if they discover a law of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Union which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they protest against it as an abuse of force; and if their ardent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"progress of society in America is precipitate, and almost revolutionary.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The same citizen may have lived to see his State take the lead in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,an Anglo-American republic has been known to grow as rapidly as a man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,passing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course of thirty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"years. It must not be imagined, however, that the States which lose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their preponderance, also lose their population or their riches: no stop","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is put to their prosperity, and they even go on to increase more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rapidly than any kingdom in Europe. *r But they believe themselves to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impoverished because their wealth does not augment as rapidly as that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their neighbors; any they think that their power is lost, because they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,thus they are more hurt in their feelings and their passions than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"increase of fortune; and to awaken in others those feelings of envy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"mistrust, and regret which usually attend upon the loss of it. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans contemplate this extraordinary and hasty progress with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with sorrow and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,alarm. The Americans of the United States must inevitably become one of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the greatest nations in the world; their offset will cover almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the whole of North America; the continent which they inhabit is their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"dominion, and it cannot escape them. What urges them to take possession","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of it so soon? Riches, power, and renown cannot fail to be theirs at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some future time, but they rush upon their fortune as if but a moment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remained for them to make it their own.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I think that I have demonstrated that the existence of the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confederates; and, starting from this principle, I have inquired into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the causes which may induce the several States to separate from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"others. The Union may, however, perish in two different ways: one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the confederate States may choose to retire from the compact, and so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forcibly to sever the federal tie; and it is to this supposition that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,most of the remarks that I have made apply: or the authority of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Federal Government may be progressively entrenched on by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,simultaneous tendency of the united republics to resume their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence. The central power, successively stripped of all its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prerogatives, and reduced to impotence by tacit consent, would become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"incompetent to fulfil its purpose; and the second Union would perish,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like the first, by a sort of senile inaptitude. The gradual weakening of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the federal tie, which may finally lead to the dissolution of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union, is a distinct circumstance, that may produce a variety of minor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consequences before it operates so violent a change. The confederation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"might still subsist, although its Government were reduced to such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a degree of inanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"anarchy, and to check the general prosperity of the country.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,After having investigated the causes which may induce the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans to disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union continues to subsist, their Government will extend or contract","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its sphere of action, and whether it will become more energetic or more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,weak.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with alarm. They perceive that in most of the nations of the world the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise of the rights of sovereignty tends to fall under the control of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a few individuals, and they are dismayed by the idea that such will also","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be the case in their own country. Even the statesmen feel, or affect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to feel, these fears; for, in America, centralization is by no means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"popular, and there is no surer means of courting the majority than by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inveighing against the encroachments of the central power. The Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,do not perceive that the countries in which this alarming tendency to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,centralization exists are inhabited by a single people; whilst the fact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the Union being composed of different confederate communities is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be drawn from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,analogous circumstances. I confess that I am inclined to consider the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fears of a great number of Americans as purely imaginary; and far from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,participating in their dread of the consolidation of power in the hands,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Union, I think that the Federal Government is visibly losing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strength.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,To prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,which belong to our own time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,An attentive examination of what is going on in the United States will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"easily convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,like two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"channel. The Union has now existed for forty-five years, and in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"course of that time a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at first hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which attached each of the Americans to his own native State is become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,less exclusive; and the different parts of the Union have become more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intimately connected the better they have become acquainted with each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other. The post, *t that great instrument of intellectual intercourse,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,now reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established daily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,means of communication between the different points of the coast. An,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and down,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rivers of the country. *u And to these facilities of nature and art,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may be added those restless cravings, that busy-mindedness, and love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of pelf, which are constantly urging the American into active life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and bringing him into contact with his fellow-citizens. He crosses the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country in every direction; he visits all the various populations of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,land; and there is not a province in France in which the natives are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"so well known to each other as the 13,000,000 of men who cover the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"their institutions, diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"common type. Every year, thousands of men leave the North to settle in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different parts of the Union: they bring with them their faith, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"men amongst whom they are about to dwell, they soon rise to the head of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs, and they adapt society to their own advantage. This continual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,emigration of the North to the South is peculiarly favorable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fusion of all the different provincial characters into one national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,by the increasing manufactures of the Americans; and the union which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,habits: the course of time has swept away the bugbear thoughts which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,haunted the imaginations of the citizens in 1789. The federal power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"Nevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,for the last forty-five years will readily convince us that the federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"phenomenon. *v When the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation was a prey to anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,excited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly supported,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"because it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although it was more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attacked than it is now, the federal power soon reached the maximum of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its authority, as is usually the case with a government which triumphs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,after having braced its strength by the struggle. At that time the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interpretation of the Constitution seemed to extend, rather than to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"repress, the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered, in several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"respects, the appearance of a single and undivided people, directed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,its foreign and internal policy by a single Government. But to attain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this point the people had risen, to a certain extent, above itself.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote v: [Since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"direction, and the federal power has largely increased, and tends to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,further increase.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States; and all communities, of whatever nature they may be, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impelled by a secret propensity to assert their independence. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"propensity is still more decided in a country like America, in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every village forms a sort of republic accustomed to conduct its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affairs. It therefore cost the States an effort to submit to the federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supremacy; and all efforts, however successful they may be, necessarily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,subside with the causes in which they originated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As the Federal Government consolidated its authority, America resumed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its rank amongst the nations, peace returned to its frontiers, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,public credit was restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"things, which was favorable to the full and free exercise of industrious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,enterprise. It was this very prosperity which made the Americans forget,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the cause to which it was attributable; and when once the danger was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"passed, the energy and the patriotism which had enabled them to brave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it disappeared from amongst them. No sooner were they delivered from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cares which oppressed them, than they easily returned to their ordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habits, and gave themselves up without resistance to their natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inclinations. When a powerful Government no longer appeared to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be necessary, they once more began to think it irksome. The Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"encouraged a general prosperity, and the States were not inclined to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abandon the Union; but they desired to render the action of the power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which represented that body as light as possible. The general principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Union was adopted, but in every minor detail there was an actual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tendency to independence. The principle of confederation was every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"day more easily admitted, and more rarely applied; so that the Federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government brought about its own decline, whilst it was creating order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and peace.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As soon as this tendency of public opinion began to be manifested,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"externally, the leaders of parties, who live by the passions of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, began to work it to their own advantage. The position of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Federal Government then became exceedingly critical. Its enemies were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in possession of the popular favor; and they obtained the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conducting its policy by pledging themselves to lessen its influence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,From that time forwards the Government of the Union has invariably been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"obliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the lists with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the governments of the States. And whenever an interpretation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the terms of the Federal Constitution has been called for, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interpretation has most frequently been opposed to the Union, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,favorable to the States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution invested the Federal Government with the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,providing for the interests of the nation; and it had been held that no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"other authority was so fit to superintend the ""internal improvements""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which affected the prosperity of the whole Union; such, for instance, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the cutting of canals. But the States were alarmed at a power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinct from their own, which could thus dispose of a portion of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"territory; and they were afraid that the central Government would, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"this means, acquire a formidable extent of patronage within their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"confines, and exercise a degree of influence which they intended to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reserve exclusively to their own agents. The Democratic party, which has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constantly been opposed to the increase of the federal authority,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"then accused the Congress of usurpation, and the Chief Magistrate of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ambition. The central Government was intimidated by the opposition;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and it soon acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence for the future within the circle which was prescribed to it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Constitution confers upon the Union the right of treating with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign nations. The Indian tribes, which border upon the frontiers of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States, had usually been regarded in this light. As long as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these savages consented to retire before the civilized settlers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the federal right was not contested: but as soon as an Indian tribe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"attempted to fix its dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,claimed possession of the lands and the rights of sovereignty over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natives. The central Government soon recognized both these claims; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after it had concluded treaties with the Indians as independent nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it gave them up as subjects to the legislative tyranny of the States. *w,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote w: See in the Legislative Documents, already quoted in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"speaking of the Indians, the letter of the President of the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"agents, and his messages to Congress.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Some of the States which had been founded upon the coast of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Atlantic, extended indefinitely to the West, into wild regions where no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,European had ever penetrated. The States whose confines were irrevocably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fixed, looked with a jealous eye upon the unbounded regions which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"future would enable their neighbors to explore. The latter then agreed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate the act","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,territory which lay beyond those limits to the confederation at large.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*x Thenceforward the Federal Government became the owner of all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,uncultivated lands which lie beyond the borders of the thirteen States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,first confederated. It was invested with the right of parcelling and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"selling them, and the sums derived from this source were exclusively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"reserved to the public treasure of the Union, in order to furnish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"supplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indians, for opening","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"roads to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the increase of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization as much as possible. New States have, however, been formed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the course of time, in the midst of those wilds which were formerly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ceded by the inhabitants of the shores of the Atlantic. Congress has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"gone on to sell, for the profit of the nation at large, the uncultivated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lands which those new States contained. But the latter at length,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"asserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they ought to enjoy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the exclusive right of converting the produce of these sales to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own use. As their remonstrances became more and more threatening,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Congress thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of the privileges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it passed a law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by which the greatest part of the revenue derived from the sale of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"lands was made over to the new western republics, although the lands","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves were not ceded to them. *y,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The slightest observation in the United States enables one to appreciate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the advantages which the country derives from the bank. These advantages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are of several kinds, but one of them is peculiarly striking to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,stranger. The banknotes of the United States are taken upon the borders,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the desert for the same value as at Philadelphia, where the bank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conducts its operations. *z,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote z: The present Bank of the United States was established in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"1816, with a capital of $35,000,000; its charter expires in 1836. Last","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"year Congress passed a law to renew it, but the President put his veto","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the bill. The struggle is still going on with great violence on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"either side, and the speedy fall of the bank may easily be foreseen. [It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was soon afterwards extinguished by General Jackson.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Bank of the United States is nevertheless the object of great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,animosity. Its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"President: and they are accused, not without some show of probability,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of having abused their influence to thwart his election. The President,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,therefore attacks the establishment which they represent with all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,warmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,his revenge by the conviction that he is supported by the secret,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,propensities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"monetary tie of the Union, just as Congress is the great legislative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tie; and the same passions which tend to render the States independent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the central power, contribute to the overthrow of the bank.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Bank of the United States always holds a great number of the notes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"issued by the provincial banks, which it can at any time oblige them to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"convert into cash. It has itself nothing to fear from a similar demand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as the extent of its resources enables it to meet all claims. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the existence of the provincial banks is thus threatened, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"operations are restricted, since they are only able to issue a quantity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of notes duly proportioned to their capital. They submit with impatience,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to this salutary control. The newspapers which they have bought over,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and the President, whose interest renders him their instrument, attack","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the bank with the greatest vehemence. They rouse the local passions and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the blind democratic instinct of the country to aid their cause; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they assert that the bank directors form a permanent aristocratic body,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whose influence must ultimately be felt in the Government, and must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affect those principles of equality upon which society rests in America.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the great struggle which is going on in America between the provinces,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the central power; between the spirit of democratic independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the spirit of gradation and subordination. I do not mean that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enemies of the bank are identically the same individuals who, on other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"points, attack the Federal Government; but I assert that the attacks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,directed against the bank of the United States originate in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,propensities which militate against the Federal Government; and that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very numerous opponents of the former afford a deplorable symptom of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,decreasing support of the latter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,question of the tariff. *a The wars of the French Revolution and of 1812,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had created manufacturing establishments in the North of the Union,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by cutting off all free communication between America and Europe. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peace was concluded, and the channel of intercourse reopened by which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the produce of Europe was transmitted to the New World, the Americans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thought fit to establish a system of import duties, for the twofold","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,purpose of protecting their incipient manufactures and of paying off the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"amount of the debt contracted during the war. The Southern States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclusively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"agricultural, soon complained of this measure. Such were the simple","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"facts, and I do not pretend to examine in this place whether their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,complaints were well founded or unjust.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote a: See principally for the details of this affair, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Legislative Documents, 22d Congress, 2d Session, No. 30.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"As early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a petition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to Congress, that the tariff was ""unconstitutional, oppressive, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"unjust."" And the States of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and Mississippi subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vigor. But Congress, far from lending an ear to these complaints, raised","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the scale of tariff duties in the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,anew the principle on which it was founded. A doctrine was then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proclaimed, or rather revived, in the South, which took the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Nullification.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I have shown in the proper place that the object of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution was not to form a league, but to create a national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,government. The Americans of the United States form a sole and undivided,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people, in all the cases which are specified by that Constitution; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon these points the will of the nation is expressed, as it is in all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"constitutional nations, by the voice of the majority. When the majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has pronounced its decision, it is the duty of the minority to submit.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Such is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one which agrees with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"text of the Constitution, and the known intention of those who framed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The partisans of Nullification in the South maintain, on the contrary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that the intention of the Americans in uniting was not to reduce,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves to the condition of one and the same people; that they meant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to constitute a league of independent States; and that each State,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consequently retains its entire sovereignty, if not de facto, at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,de jure; and has the right of putting its own construction upon the laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Congress, and of suspending their execution within the limits of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own territory, if they are held to be unconstitutional and unjust.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the South,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before the Senate of the United States, in the year 1833: could: ""The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Constitution is a compact to which the States were parties in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"sovereign capacity; now, whenever a compact is entered into by parties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which acknowledge no tribunal above their authority to decide in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"last resort, each of them has a right to judge for itself in relation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the nature, extent, and obligations of the instrument."" It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,evident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution, and brings back all the evils of the old confederation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from which the Americans were supposed to have had a safe deliverance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,When South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a deaf ear to its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the federal tariff bill. Congress persisted in its former system; and at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,length the storm broke out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"South Carolina, *b named a national Convention, to consult upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extraordinary measures which they were called upon to take; and on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"November 24th of the same year this Convention promulgated a law, under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the form of a decree, which annulled the federal law of the tariff,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"forbade the levy of the imposts which that law commands, and refused to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,recognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of law.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,*c This decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"February, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified the tariff","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"before that period, South Carolina might be induced to proceed no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,further with her menaces; and a vague desire was afterwards expressed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of submitting the question to an extraordinary assembly of all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confederate States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote b: That is to say, the majority of the people; for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"active minority. Carolina may contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote c: This decree was preceded by a report of the committee,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by which it was framed, containing the explanation of the motives and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"object of the law. The following passage occurs in it, p. 34:--""When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rights reserved by the Constitution to the different States are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"deliberately violated, it is the duty and the right of those States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"usurpation, and to maintain, within their respective limits, those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,powers and privileges which belong to them as independent sovereign,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States. If they were destitute of this right, they would not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sovereign. South Carolina declares that she acknowledges no tribunal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"compact of union with the other States; but she demands, and will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"another bill, by which the President was invested with extraordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"powers, enabling him to overcome by force a resistance which was then no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,longer to be apprehended.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote d: Congress was finally decided to take this step by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"conduct of the powerful State of Virginia, whose legislature offered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to serve as mediator between the Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"latter State had appeared to be entirely abandoned, even by the States","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which had joined in her remonstrances.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote e: This law was passed on March 2, 1833.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote f: This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,days through both Houses of Congress by an immense majority.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But South Carolina did not consent to leave the Union in the enjoyment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of these scanty trophies of success: the same national Convention which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"had annulled the tariff bill, met again, and accepted the proffered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,concession; but at the same time it declared it unabated perseverance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in the doctrine of Nullification: and to prove what it said, it annulled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the law investing the President with extraordinary powers, although it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was very certain that the clauses of that law would never be carried,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,into effect.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Almost all the controversies of which I have been speaking have taken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,place under the Presidency of General Jackson; and it cannot be denied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that in the question of the tariff he has supported the claims of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Union with vigor and with skill. I am, however, of opinion that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conduct of the individual who now represents the Federal Government may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be reckoned as one of the dangers which threaten its continuance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Some persons in Europe have formed an opinion of the possible influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of General Jackson upon the affairs of his country, which appears highly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extravagant to those who have seen more of the subject. We have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been told that General Jackson has won sundry battles, that he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an energetic man, prone by nature and by habit to the use of force,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"covetous of power, and a despot by taste. All this may perhaps be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true; but the inferences which have been drawn from these truths are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exceedingly erroneous. It has been imagined that General Jackson is bent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"on establishing a dictatorship in America, on introducing a military","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spirit, and on giving a degree of influence to the central authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties. But in America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the time for similar undertakings, and the age for men of this kind, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not yet come: if General Jackson had entertained a hope of exercising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his authority in this manner, he would infallibly have forfeited his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"political station, and compromised his life; accordingly he has not been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,so imprudent as to make any such attempt.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Far from wishing to extend the federal power, the President belongs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the bare and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"precise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon that act favorable to the Government of the Union; far from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"standing forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the agent of all the jealousies of the States; and he was placed in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lofty station he occupies by the passions of the people which are most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,opposed to the central Government. It is by perpetually flattering,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity. General,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"propensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forestalls them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Whenever the governments of the States come into collision with that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the Union, the President is generally the first to question his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rights: he almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the federal power is controverted, he takes part, as it were, against","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"himself; he conceals his official interests, and extinguishes his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,natural inclinations. Not indeed that he is naturally weak or hostile,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the Union; for when the majority decided against the claims of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"partisans of nullification, he put himself at its head, asserted the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"doctrines which the nation held distinctly and energetically, and was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the first to recommend forcible measures; but General Jackson appears to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"me, if I may use the American expressions, to be a Federalist by taste,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and a Republican by calculation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"General Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority, but when he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"feels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pursuit of the objects which the community approves, or of those which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it does not look upon with a jealous eye. He is supported by a power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with which his predecessors were unacquainted; and he tramples on his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility which no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,former President ever enjoyed; he takes upon himself the responsibility,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of measures which no one before him would have ventured to attempt: he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,even treats the national representatives with disdain approaching to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"insult; he puts his veto upon the laws of Congress, and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,neglects to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,treats his master roughly. The power of General Jackson perpetually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,increases; but that of the President declines; in his hands the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government is strong, but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,successor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I am strangely mistaken if the Federal Government of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be not constantly losing strength, retiring gradually from public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs, and narrowing its circle of action more and more. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naturally feeble, but it now abandons even its pretensions to strength.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"On the other hand, I thought that I remarked a more lively sense of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independence, and a more decided attachment to provincial government in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the States. The Union is to subsist, but to subsist as a shadow; it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is to be strong in certain cases, and weak in all others; in time of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"warfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces of the nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and all the resources of the country in its hands; and in time of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peace its existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,debility and vigor were natural or possible.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I do not foresee anything for the present which may be able to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,check this general impulse of public opinion; the causes in which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,originated do not cease to operate with the same effect. The change will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore go on, and it may be predicted that, unless some extraordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"event occurs, the Government of the Union will grow weaker and weaker","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every day.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I think, however, that the period is still remote at which the federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power will be entirely extinguished by its inability to protect itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and to maintain peace in the country. The Union is sanctioned by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the manners and desires of the people; its results are palpable, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,benefits visible. When it is perceived that the weakness of the Federal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Government compromises the existence of the Union, I do not doubt that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reaction will take place with a view to increase its strength.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Government of the United States is, of all the federal governments","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,destined to act. As long as it is only indirectly assailed by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"interpretation of its laws, and as long as its substance is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"seriously altered, a change of opinion, an internal crisis, or a war,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,may restore all the vigor which it requires. The point which I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been most anxious to put in a clear light is simply this: Many people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"especially in France, imagine that a change in opinion is going on in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States, which is favorable to a centralization of power in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the hands of the President and the Congress. I hold that a contrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,tendency may distinctly be observed. So far is the Federal Government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"from acquiring strength, and from threatening the sovereignty of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, as it grows older, that I maintain it to be growing weaker and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"weaker, and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are the facts which the present time discloses. The future conceals the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"final result of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or accelerate the changes I have described; but I do not affect to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Of The Republican Institutions Of The United States, And What Their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Chances Of Duration Are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Union is accidental--The Republican institutions have more prospect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of permanence--A republic for the present the natural state of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Anglo-Americans--Reason of this--In order to destroy it, all the laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"must be changed at the same time, and a great alteration take place","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in manners--Difficulties experienced by the Americans in creating an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of war into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"heart of those States which are now confederate, with standing armies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a dictatorship, and a heavy taxation, might, eventually, compromise the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fate of the republican institutions. But we ought not to confound the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,future prospects of the republic with those of the Union. The Union is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"an accident, which will only last as long as circumstances are favorable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to its existence; but a republican form of government seems to me to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be the natural state of the Americans; which nothing but the continued,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"action of hostile causes, always acting in the same direction, could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,change into a monarchy. The Union exists principally in the law which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"formed it; one revolution, one change in public opinion, might destroy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it forever; but the republic has a much deeper foundation to rest upon.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,What is understood by a republican government in the United States is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the slow and quiet action of society upon itself. It is a regular state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of things really founded upon the enlightened will of the people. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a conciliatory government under which resolutions are allowed time to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"ripen; and in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,mature judgment. The republicans in the United States set a high value,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"upon morality, respect religious belief, and acknowledge the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,existence of rights. They profess to think that a people ought to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moral, religious, and temperate, in proportion as it is free. What is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"called the republic in the United States, is the tranquil rule of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"majority, which, after having had time to examine itself, and to give","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proof of its existence, is the common source of all the powers of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,State. But the power of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"moral world humanity, justice, and reason enjoy an undisputed supremacy;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in the political world vested rights are treated with no less deference.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The majority recognizes these two barriers; and if it now and then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"overstep them, it is because, like individuals, it has passions, and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like them, it is prone to do what is wrong, whilst it discerns what is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,right.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But the demagogues of Europe have made strange discoveries. A republic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is not, according to them, the rule of the majority, as has hitherto","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"been thought, but the rule of those who are strenuous partisans of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the majority. It is not the people who preponderates in this kind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, but those who are best versed in the good qualities of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people. A happy distinction, which allows men to act in the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations without consulting them, and to claim their gratitude whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their rights are spurned. A republican government, moreover, is the only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one which claims the right of doing whatever it chooses, and despising","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"what men have hitherto respected, from the highest moral obligations to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the vulgar rules of common-sense. It had been supposed, until our time,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that despotism was odious, under whatever form it appeared. But it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a discovery of modern days that there are such things as legitimate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tyranny and holy injustice, provided they are exercised in the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The ideas which the Americans have adopted respecting the republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"form of government, render it easy for them to live under it, and insure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"its duration. If, in their country, this form be often practically bad,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"at least it is theoretically good; and, in the end, the people always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,acts in conformity to it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It was impossible at the foundation of the States, and it would still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"be difficult, to establish a central administration in America. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants are dispersed over too great a space, and separated by too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"many natural obstacles, for one man to undertake to direct the details","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of their existence. America is therefore pre-eminently the country of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"provincial and municipal government. To this cause, which was plainly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"felt by all the Europeans of the New World, the Anglo-Americans added","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,several others peculiar to themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"At the time of the settlement of the North American colonies, municipal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberty had already penetrated into the laws as well as the manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the English; and the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"thing, but as a benefit which they knew how to appreciate. We have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,already seen the manner in which the colonies were founded: every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"province, and almost every district, was peopled separately by men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"were strangers to each other, or who associated with very different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purposes. The English settlers in the United States, therefore, early","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,perceived that they were divided into a great number of small and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,distinct communities which belonged to no common centre; and that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,was needful for each of these little communities to take care of its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"affairs, since there did not appear to be any central authority which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"was naturally bound and easily enabled to provide for them. Thus, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nature of the country, the manner in which the British colonies were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"founded, the habits of the first emigrants, in short everything,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"united to promote, in an extraordinary degree, municipal and provincial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,liberties.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States, therefore, the mass of the institutions of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country is essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the laws which form the basis of the republic, it would be necessary to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,abolish all the laws at once. At the present day it would be even more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,difficult for a party to succeed in founding a monarchy in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States than for a set of men to proclaim that France should henceforward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,be a republic. Royalty would not find a system of legislation prepared,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for it beforehand; and a monarchy would then exist, really surrounded by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,republican institutions. The monarchical principle would likewise have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great difficulty in penetrating into the manners of the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In the United States, the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,doctrine bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people: it may, on the contrary, be regarded as the last link of a chain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of opinions which binds the whole Anglo-American world. That Providence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has given to every human being the degree of reason necessary to direct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,himself in the affairs which interest him exclusively--such is the grand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,maxim upon which civil and political society rests in the United States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The father of a family applies it to his children; the master to his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,servants; the township to its officers; the province to its townships;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the State to its provinces; the Union to the States; and when extended,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the nation, it becomes the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, in the United States, the fundamental principle of the republic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is the same which governs the greater part of human actions; republican,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"notions insinuate themselves into all the ideas, opinions, and habits of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Americans, whilst they are formerly recognized by the legislation:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and before this legislation can be altered the whole community must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"undergo very serious changes. In the United States, even the religion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"most of the citizens is republican, since it submits the truths of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other world to private judgment: as in politics the care of its temporal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,interests is abandoned to the good sense of the people. Thus every man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is allowed freely to take that road which he thinks will lead him to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,heaven; just as the law permits every citizen to have the right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,choosing his government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws, opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and manners, a mass of opposite opinions, manners, and laws.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If republican principles are to perish in America, they can only yield","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"after a laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resumed; they will have many apparent revivals, and will not become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,totally extinct until an entirely new people shall have succeeded to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that which now exists. Now, it must be admitted that there is no symptom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or presage of the approach of such a revolution. There is nothing more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"striking to a person newly arrived in the United States, than the kind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of tumultuous agitation in which he finds political society. The laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are incessantly changing, and at first sight it seems impossible that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"people so variable in its desires should avoid adopting, within a short","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"space of time, a completely new form of government. Such apprehensions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are, however, premature; the instability which affects political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions is of two kinds, which ought not to be confounded: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"first, which modifies secondary laws, is not incompatible with a very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,settled state of society; the other shakes the very foundations of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Constitution, and attacks the fundamental principles of legislation;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this species of instability is always followed by troubles and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"revolutions, and the nation which suffers under it is in a state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,violent transition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Experience shows that these two kinds of legislative instability have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"no necessary connection; for they have been found united or separate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,according to times and circumstances. The first is common in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States, but not the second: the Americans often change their laws, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the foundation of the Constitution is respected.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"In our days the republican principle rules in America, as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,monarchical principle did in France under Louis XIV. The French of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that period were not only friends of the monarchy, but they thought it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,impossible to put anything in its place; they received it as we receive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the rays of the sun and the return of the seasons. Amongst them the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,royal power had neither advocates nor opponents. In like manner does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the republican government exist in America, without contention or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a sort","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of consensus universalis. It is, however, my opinion that by changing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,United States compromise the future stability of their government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted in their designs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"by the mutability of the legislation, will learn to look upon republican","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,institutions as an inconvenient form of society; the evil resulting from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the instability of the secondary enactments might then raise a doubt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as to the nature of the fundamental principles of the Constitution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and indirectly bring about a revolution; but this epoch is still very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,remote.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the Americans lose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their republican institutions they will speedily arrive at a despotic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"government, without a long interval of limited monarchy. Montesquieu","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"remarked, that nothing is more absolute than the authority of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prince who immediately succeeds a republic, since the powers which had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fearlessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then transferred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to a hereditary sovereign. This is true in general, but it is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"peculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the magistrates are not elected by a particular class of citizens, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,by the majority of the nation; they are the immediate representatives of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the passions of the multitude; and as they are wholly dependent upon its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"pleasure, they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I have already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shown, very little care has been taken to limit their influence, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary power. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,state of things has engendered habits which would outlive itself; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American magistrate would retain his power, but he would cease to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,responsible for the exercise of it; and it is impossible to say what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bounds could then be set to tyranny.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Some of our European politicians expect to see an aristocracy arise in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America, and they already predict the exact period at which it will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"able to assume the reins of government. I have previously observed, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I repeat my assertion, that the present tendency of American society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appears to me to become more and more democratic. Nevertheless, I do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"assert that the Americans will not, at some future time, restrict the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circle of political rights in their country, or confiscate those rights","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to the advantage of a single individual; but I cannot imagine that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a privileged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"class of citizens, or, in other words, that they will ever found an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,An aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who, without being very far removed from the mass of the people, are,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nevertheless, permanently stationed above it: a body which it is easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to touch and difficult to strike; with which the people are in daily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contact, but with which they can never combine. Nothing can be imagined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more contrary to nature and to the secret propensities of the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,heart than a subjection of this kind; and men who are left to follow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own bent will always prefer the arbitrary power of a king to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,regular administration of an aristocracy. Aristocratic institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,cannot subsist without laying down the inequality of men as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fundamental principle, as a part and parcel of the legislation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affecting the condition of the human family as much as it affects that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of society; but these are things so repugnant to natural equity that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they can only be extorted from men by constraint.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I do not think a single people can be quoted, since human society began","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to exist, which has, by its own free will and by its own exertions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,created an aristocracy within its own bosom. All the aristocracies of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Middle Ages were founded by military conquest; the conqueror was the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"noble, the vanquished became the serf. Inequality was then imposed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,force; and after it had been introduced into the manners of the country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it maintained its own authority, and was sanctioned by the legislation.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Communities have existed which were aristocratic from their earliest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"origin, owing to circumstances anterior to that event, and which became","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more democratic in each succeeding age. Such was the destiny of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Romans, and of the barbarians after them. But a people, having taken its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rise in civilization and democracy, which should gradually establish an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inequality of conditions, until it arrived at inviolable privileges and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exclusive castes, would be a novelty in the world; and nothing intimates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,"people, which fortune has placed in the midst of an uncultivated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,country at a distance of three thousand miles from the central point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of civilization. America consequently stands in daily need of European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"trade. The Americans will, no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manufacturing at home most of the articles which they require; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"two continents can never be independent of each other, so numerous are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the natural ties which exist between their wants, their ideas, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"habits, and their manners.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Union produces peculiar commodities which are now become necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to us, but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enormous expense, upon the soil of Europe. The Americans only consume a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"small portion of this produce, and they are willing to sell us the rest.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe is therefore the market of America, as America is the market","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Europe; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to enable the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants of the United States to transport their raw materials to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply them with our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,manufactured produce. The United States were therefore necessarily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reduced to the alternative of increasing the business of other maritime,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nations to a great extent, if they had themselves declined to enter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"into commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"second place, of becoming one of the first trading powers of the globe.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sea. The Declaration of Independence broke the commercial restrictions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which united them to England, and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their maritime genius. Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has increased in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants. The Americans themselves now transport to their own shores,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nine-tenths of the European produce which they consume. *g And they also,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,bring three-quarters of the exports of the New World to the European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,consumer. *h The ships of the United States fill the docks of Havre and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of Liverpool; whilst the number of English and French vessels which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be seen at New York is comparatively small. *i,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,[Footnote i: The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Union in the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of which 544,571 tons were foreign vessels; they stood, therefore,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the American vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. (""National","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Calendar,"" 1833, p. 304.) The tonnage of the English vessels which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entered the ports of London, Liverpool, and Hull, in the years 1820,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"1826, and 1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. The foreign vessels which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"entered the same ports during the same years amounted to 159,431 tons.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The ratio between them was, therefore, about 36 to 100. (""Companion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the Almanac,"" 1834, p. 169.) In the year 1832 the ratio between the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,foreign and British ships which entered the ports of Great Britain was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,29 to 100. [These statements relate to a condition of affairs which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,has ceased to exist; the Civil War and the heavy taxation of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States entirely altered the trade and navigation of the country.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, not only does the American merchant face the competition of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"own countrymen, but he even supports that of foreign nations in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,own ports with success. This is readily explained by the fact that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,vessels of the United States can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,any other vessels in the world. As long as the mercantile shipping of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the United States preserves this superiority, it will not only retain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"what it has acquired, but it will constantly increase in prosperity.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part X,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,lower rate than other nations; and one is at first led to attribute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this circumstance to the physical or natural advantages which are within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their reach; but this supposition is erroneous. The American vessels,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"cost almost as much to build as our own; *j they are not better built,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and they generally last for a shorter time. The pay of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sailor is more considerable than the pay on board European ships; which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be met with in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,merchant vessels of the United States. But I am of opinion that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,true cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their moral and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intellectual qualities.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote j: Materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"America than in Europe, but the price of labor is much higher.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The following comparison will illustrate my meaning. During the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,campaigns of the Revolution the French introduced a new system of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tactics into the art of war, which perplexed the oldest generals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and very nearly destroyed the most ancient monarchies in Europe. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,undertook (what had never before been attempted) to make shift without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a number of things which had always been held to be indispensable in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,warfare; they required novel exertions on the part of their troops which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,no civilized nations had ever thought of; they achieved great actions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,in an incredibly short space of time; and they risked human life without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,hesitation to obtain the object in view. The French had less money and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fewer men than their enemies; their resources were infinitely inferior;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nevertheless they were constantly victorious, until their adversaries","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,chose to imitate their example.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans have introduced a similar system into their commercial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,speculations; and they do for cheapness what the French did for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,conquest. The European sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets sail,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"when the weather is favorable; if an unforseen accident befalls him, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,puts into port; at night he furls a portion of his canvas; and when the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"whitening billows intimate the vicinity of land, he checks his way,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and takes an observation of the sun. But the American neglects these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,precautions and braves these dangers. He weighs anchor in the midst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his sheets to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,wind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,sustained from the storm; and when he at last approaches the term of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"voyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a port.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the seas so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"rapidly. And as they perform the same distance in a shorter time, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,can perform it at a cheaper rate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The European touches several times at different ports in the course of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"long voyage; he loses a good deal of precious time in making the harbor,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,or in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays daily dues,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to be allowed to remain there. The American starts from Boston to go to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"purchase tea in China; he arrives at Canton, stays there a few days, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,then returns. In less than two years he has sailed as far as the entire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"circumference of the globe, and he has seen land but once. It is true","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,that during a voyage of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and lived upon salt meat; that he has been in a continual contest with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the sea, with disease, and with a tedious existence; but upon his return","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,he can sell a pound of his tea for a half-penny less than the English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"merchant, and his purpose is accomplished.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I cannot better explain my meaning than by saying that the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,affect a sort of heroism in their manner of trading. But the European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,merchant will always find it very difficult to imitate his American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"competitor, who, in adopting the system which I have just described,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"follows not only a calculation of his gain, but an impulse of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The inhabitants of the United States are subject to all the wants and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,all the desires which result from an advanced stage of civilization; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as they are not surrounded by a community admirably adapted, like that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of Europe, to satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to procure for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,themselves the various articles which education and habit have rendered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,necessaries. In America it sometimes happens that the same individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"tills his field, builds his dwelling, contrives his tools, makes his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shoes, and weaves the coarse stuff of which his dress is composed.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,This circumstance is prejudicial to the excellence of the work; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it powerfully contributes to awaken the intelligence of the workman.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor. In a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country like America, where men devoted to special occupations are rare,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a long apprenticeship cannot be required from anyone who embraces a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"profession. The Americans, therefore, change their means of gaining","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a livelihood very readily; and they suit their occupations to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exigencies of the moment, in the manner most profitable to themselves.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Men are to be met with who have successively been barristers, farmers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"merchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians. If the American be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"less perfect in each craft than the European, at least there is scarcely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,any trade with which he is utterly unacquainted. His capacity is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"general, and the circle of his intelligence is enlarged.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The inhabitants of the United States are never fettered by the axioms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,station; they are not more attached to one line of operation than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,another; they are not more prone to employ an old method than a new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one; they have no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the habits of other nations might exercise upon their minds from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a conviction that their country is unlike any other, and that its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,situation is without a precedent in the world. America is a land of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,seems an improvement. The idea of novelty is there indissolubly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,connected with the idea of amelioration. No natural boundary seems to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,set to the efforts of man; and what is not yet done is only what he has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,not yet attempted to do.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"This perpetual change which goes on in the United States, these frequent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"vicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such unforeseen fluctuations in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"private and in public wealth, serve to keep the minds of the citizens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"in a perpetual state of feverish agitation, which admirably invigorates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"their exertions, and keeps them in a state of excitement above the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ordinary level of mankind. The whole life of an American is passed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"like a game of chance, a revolutionary crisis, or a battle. As the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same causes are continually in operation throughout the country, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the national character. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"American, taken as a chance specimen of his countrymen, must then be a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"man of singular warmth in his desires, enterprising, fond of adventure,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and, above all, of innovation. The same bent is manifest in all that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"does; he introduces it into his political laws, his religious doctrines,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"his theories of social economy, and his domestic occupations; he bears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it with him in the depths of the backwoods, as well as in the business","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the city. It is this same passion, applied to maritime commerce,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which makes him the cheapest and the quickest trader in the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,As long as the sailors of the United States retain these inspiriting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"advantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"consumers of their own country, but they will tend more and more to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"become, like the English, the factors of all other peoples. *k This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prediction has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,American traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,still wider field to their enterprise.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote k: It must not be supposed that English vessels are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exclusively employed in transporting foreign produce into England, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,British produce to foreign countries; at the present day the merchant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shipping of England may be regarded in the light of a vast system of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"public conveyances, ready to serve all the producers of the world, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to open communications between all peoples. The maritime genius of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Americans prompts them to enter into competition with the English.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,carried on by American vessels.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The great colonies which were founded in South America by the Spaniards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and the Portuguese have since become empires. Civil war and oppression,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"now lay waste those extensive regions. Population does not increase, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the thinly scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"self-defense even to attempt any amelioration of their condition. Such,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"however, will not always be the case. Europe has succeeded by her own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,efforts in piercing the gloom of the Middle Ages; South America has the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,same Christian laws and Christian manners as we have; she contains all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the germs of civilization which have grown amidst the nations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Europe or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,example: why then should she always remain uncivilized? It is clear that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the question is simply one of time; at some future period, which may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"more or less remote, the inhabitants of South America will constitute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,flourishing and enlightened nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,But when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America begin to feel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the wants common to all civilized nations, they will still be unable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to satisfy those wants for themselves; as the youngest children of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, they must perforce admit the superiority of their elder","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,brethren. They will be agriculturists long before they succeed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"manufactures or commerce, and they will require the mediation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,strangers to exchange their produce beyond seas for those articles for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which a demand will begin to be felt.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is unquestionable that the Americans of the North will one day supply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the wants of the Americans of the South. Nature has placed them in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"contiguity, and has furnished the former with every means of knowing and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"appreciating those demands, of establishing a permanent connection with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"those States, and of gradually filling their markets. The merchants of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States could only forfeit these natural advantages if he were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"very inferior to the merchant of Europe; to whom he is, on the contrary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,superior in several respects. The Americans of the United States already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exercise a very considerable moral influence upon all the peoples of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the New World. They are the source of intelligence, and all the nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which inhabit the same continent are already accustomed to consider them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"as the most enlightened, the most powerful, and the most wealthy members","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of the great American family. All eyes are therefore turned towards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the Union; and the States of which that body is composed are the models,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which the other communities try to imitate to the best of their power;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,it is from the United States that they borrow their political principles,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and their laws.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The Americans of the United States stand in precisely the same position,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with regard to the peoples of South America as their fathers, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"English, occupy with regard to the Italians, the Spaniards, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Portuguese, and all those nations of Europe which receive their articles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of daily consumption from England, because they are less advanced in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,civilization and trade. England is at this time the natural emporium of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,almost all the nations which are within its reach; the American Union,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will perform the same part in the other hemisphere; and every community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which is founded, or which prospers in the New World, is founded and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prospers to the advantage of the Anglo-Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"If the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the States which now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,compose it would undoubtedly be checked for a time; but this consequence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,would be less perceptible than is generally supposed. It is evident,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that, whatever may happen, the commercial States will remain united.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,They are all contiguous to each other; they have identically the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"opinions, interests, and manners; and they are alone competent to form a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,very great maritime power. Even if the South of the Union were to become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"independent of the North, it would still require the services of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,States. I have already observed that the South is not a commercial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"country, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become so. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Americans of the South of the United States will therefore be obliged,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"for a long time to come, to have recourse to strangers to export their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"produce, and to supply them with the commodities which are requisite to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,satisfy their wants. But the Northern States are undoubtedly able to act,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as their intermediate agents cheaper than any other merchants. They will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"therefore retain that employment, for cheapness is the sovereign law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of commerce. National claims and national prejudices cannot resist the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,influence of cheapness. Nothing can be more virulent than the hatred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,which exists between the Americans of the United States and the English.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But notwithstanding these inimical feelings, the Americans derive the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"greater part of their manufactured commodities from England, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,England supplies them at a cheaper rate than any other nation. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"increasing prosperity of America turns, notwithstanding the grudges of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Americans, to the advantage of British manufactures.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Reason shows and experience proves that no commercial prosperity can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"durable if it cannot be united, in case of need, to naval force. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,truth is as well understood in the United States as it can be anywhere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,else: the Americans are already able to make their flag respected; in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,few years they will be able to make it feared. I am convinced that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,dismemberment of the Union would not have the effect of diminishing the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"naval power of the Americans, but that it would powerfully contribute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to increase it. At the present time the commercial States are connected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with others which have not the same interests, and which frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,yield an unwilling consent to the increase of a maritime power by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"they are only indirectly benefited. If, on the contrary, the commercial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"States of the Union formed one independent nation, commerce would become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the foremost of their national interests; they would consequently be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"willing to make very great sacrifices to protect their shipping, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,nothing would prevent them from pursuing their designs upon this point.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Nations, as well as men, almost always betray the most prominent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,features of their future destiny in their earliest years. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,I contemplate the ardor with which the Anglo-Americans prosecute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"commercial enterprise, the advantages which befriend them, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"success of their undertakings, I cannot refrain from believing that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,will one day become the first maritime power of the globe. They are born,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Conclusion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"I have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto, in speaking","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the future destiny of the United States, I have endeavored to divide","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"my subject into distinct portions, in order to study each of them with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,more attention. My present object is to embrace the whole from one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"single point; the remarks I shall make will be less detailed, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"will be more sure. I shall perceive each object less distinctly, but I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,shall descry the principal facts with more certainty. A traveller who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"has just left the walls of an immense city, climbs the neighboring hill;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,as he goes father off he loses sight of the men whom he has so recently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,quitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense mass; he can no longer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"distinguish the public squares, and he can scarcely trace out the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,great thoroughfares; but his eye has less difficulty in following the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"boundaries of the city, and for the first time he sees the shape of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the vast whole. Such is the future destiny of the British race in North,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,America to my eye; the details of the stupendous picture are overhung,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with shade, but I conceive a clear idea of the entire subject.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The territory now occupied or possessed by the United States of America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,forms about one-twentieth part of the habitable earth. But extensive as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"these confines are, it must not be supposed that the Anglo-American race","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"will always remain within them; indeed, it has already far overstepped","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,There was once a time at which we also might have created a great French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"nation in the American wilds, to counterbalance the influence of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,English upon the destinies of the New World. France formerly possessed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"a territory in North America, scarcely less extensive than the whole of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,Europe. The three greatest rivers of that continent then flowed within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,her dominions. The Indian tribes which dwelt between the mouth of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,St. Lawrence and the delta of the Mississippi were unaccustomed to any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,other tongue but ours; and all the European settlements scattered over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that immense region recalled the traditions of our country. Louisbourg,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Montmorency, Duquesne, St. Louis, Vincennes, New Orleans (for such were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the names they bore) are words dear to France and familiar to our ears.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"But a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"enumerate, *m have deprived us of this magnificent inheritance. Wherever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the French settlers were numerically weak and partially established,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,they have disappeared: those who remain are collected on a small extent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of country, and are now subject to other laws. The 400,000 French","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"inhabitants of Lower Canada constitute, at the present time, the remnant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,of an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A foreign population,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"is increasing around them unceasingly and on all sides, which already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"penetrates amongst the ancient masters of the country, predominates in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their cities and corrupts their language. This population is identical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,with that of the United States; it is therefore with truth that I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,asserted that the British race is not confined within the frontiers of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Union, since it already extends to the northeast.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote m: The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,are accustomed to free institutions and municipal government are better,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,able than any others to found prosperous colonies. The habit of thinking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"and governing for oneself is indispensable in a new country, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"success necessarily depends, in a great measure, upon the individual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,exertions of the settlers.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,To the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Russian settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico presents a barrier to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans are,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"properly speaking, the only two races which divide the possession of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,New World. The limits of separation between them have been settled by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,a treaty; but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"favorable to the Anglo-Americans, I do not doubt that they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shortly infringe this arrangement. Vast provinces, extending beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the frontiers of the Union towards Mexico, are still destitute of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,inhabitants. The natives of the United States will forestall the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,rightful occupants of these solitary regions. They will take possession,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of the soil, and establish social institutions, so that when the legal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"owner arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and strangers quietly settled in the midst of his inheritance. *n,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"[Footnote n: [This was speedily accomplished, and ere long both Texas","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,and California formed part of the United States. The Russian settlements,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,were acquired by purchase.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The lands of the New World belong to the first occupant, and they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even the countries which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,already peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this invasion. I have already alluded to what is taking place in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,province of Texas. The inhabitants of the United States are perpetually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"migrating to Texas, where they purchase land; and although they conform","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"to the laws of the country, they are gradually founding the empire of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,their own language and their own manners. The province of Texas is still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"part of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon contain no Mexicans;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the same thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans have come into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,contact with populations of a different origin.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an amazing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,preponderance over all the other European races in the New World; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that it is very superior to them in civilization, in industry, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,power. As long as it is only surrounded by desert or thinly peopled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"countries, as long as it encounters no dense populations upon its route,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"through which it cannot work its way, it will assuredly continue to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,spread. The lines marked out by treaties will not stop it; but it will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,everywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The geographical position of the British race in the New World is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,peculiarly favorable to its rapid increase. Above its northern frontiers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the icy regions of the Pole extend; and a few degrees below its southern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,confines lies the burning climate of the Equator. The Anglo-Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"are, therefore, placed in the most temperate and habitable zone of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,continent.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,It is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of population in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the United States is posterior to their Declaration of Independence. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,this is an error: the population increased as rapidly under the colonial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"system as it does at the present day; that is to say, it doubled in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,about twenty-two years. But this proportion which is now applied to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"millions, was then applied to thousands of inhabitants; and the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"fact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago, is now evident to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,every observer.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"The British subjects in Canada, who are dependent on a king, augment and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"spread almost as rapidly as the British settlers of the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"who live under a republican government. During the war of independence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which lasted eight years, the population continued to increase without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intermission in the same ratio. Although powerful Indian nations allied,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"with the English existed at that time upon the western frontiers, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,emigration westward was never checked. Whilst the enemy laid waste the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"shores of the Atlantic, Kentucky, the western parts of Pennsylvania, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the States of Vermont and of Maine were filling with inhabitants. Nor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"did the unsettled state of the Constitution, which succeeded the war,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevent the increase of the population, or stop its progress across the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"wilds. Thus, the difference of laws, the various conditions of peace and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"war, of order and of anarchy, have exercised no perceptible influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,upon the gradual development of the Anglo-Americans. This may be readily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"understood; for the fact is, that no causes are sufficiently general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,to exercise a simultaneous influence over the whole of so extensive a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,territory. One portion of the country always offers a sure retreat from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,the calamities which afflict another part; and however great may be the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"evil, the remedy which is at hand is greater still.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"It must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the New World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"the hostilities which might ensure, the abolition of republican","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"institutions, and the tyrannical government which might succeed it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"may retard this impulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,fulfilling the destinies to which that race is reserved. No power upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,earth can close upon the emigrants that fertile wilderness which offers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"resources to all industry, and a refuge from all want. Future events,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"of whatever nature they may be, will not deprive the Americans of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"climate or of their inland seas, of their great rivers or of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"exuberant soil. Nor will bad laws, revolutions, and anarchy be able to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,obliterate that love of prosperity and that spirit of enterprise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"which seem to be the distinctive characteristics of their race, or to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extinguish that knowledge which guides them on their way.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"Thus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,At a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"life of a nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"space contained between the polar regions and the tropics, extending","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,from the coasts of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,territory which will probably be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"some future time, may be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,extent. *o The climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"that of Europe, and its natural advantages are not less great; it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is therefore evident that its population will at some future time be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"proportionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"different nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"barbarous manners of the Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,population of 410 inhabitants to the square league. *p What cause can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,prevent the United States from having as numerous a population in time?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,[Footnote o: The United States already extend over a territory equal to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one-half of Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square leagues, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,civilization. The British of the New World have a thousand other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,reciprocal ties; and they live at a time when the tendency to equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,is general amongst mankind. The Middle Ages were a period when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"everything was broken up; when each people, each province, each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"city, and each family, had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,individuality. At the present time an opposite tendency seems to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"prevail, and the nations seem to be advancing to unity. Our means of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,intellectual intercourse unite the most remote parts of the earth; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"it is impossible for men to remain strangers to each other, or to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,ignorant of the events which are taking place in any corner of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"globe. The consequence is that there is less difference, at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"day, between the Europeans and their descendants in the New World, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,there was between certain towns in the thirteenth century which were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,only separated by a river. If this tendency to assimilation brings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"foreign nations closer to each other, it must a fortiori prevent the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,descendants of the same people from becoming aliens to each other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,The time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"will be living in North America, *q equal in condition, the progeny of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"one race, owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"civilization, the same language, the same religion, the same habits, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same manners, and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"same forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is a fact","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,new to the world--a fact fraught with such portentous consequences as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

815,grown up unnoticed; and whilst the attention of mankind was directed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
815,"elsewhere, they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place amongst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,De Tocqueville's Preface To The Second Part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The Americans live in a democratic state of society, which has naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,suggested to them certain laws and a certain political character. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same state of society has, moreover, engendered amongst them a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,multitude of feelings and opinions which were unknown amongst the elder,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic communities of Europe: it has destroyed or modified all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"relations which before existed, and established others of a novel kind.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The--aspect of civil society has been no less affected by these changes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than that of the political world. The former subject has been treated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of in the work on the Democracy of America, which I published five years","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ago; to examine the latter is the object of the present book; but these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"two parts complete each other, and form one and the same work.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I must at once warn the reader against an error which would be extremely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prejudicial to me. When he finds that I attribute so many different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequences to the principle of equality, he may thence infer that I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consider that principle to be the sole cause of all that takes place in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the present age: but this would be to impute to me a very narrow view. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"multitude of opinions, feelings, and propensities are now in existence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which owe their origin to circumstances unconnected with or even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contrary to the principle of equality. Thus if I were to select the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States as an example, I could easily prove that the nature of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, the origin of its inhabitants, the religion of its founders,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their acquired knowledge, and their former habits, have exercised, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still exercise, independently of democracy, a vast influence upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thoughts and feelings of that people. Different causes, but no less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distinct from the circumstance of the equality of conditions, might be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"traced in Europe, and would explain a great portion of the occurrences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taking place amongst us.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I acknowledge the existence of all these different causes, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power, but my subject does not lead me to treat of them. I have not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,undertaken to unfold the reason of all our inclinations and all our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions: my only object is to show in what respects the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality has modified both the former and the latter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Some readers may perhaps be astonished that--firmly persuaded as I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,am that the democratic revolution which we are witnessing is an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,irresistible fact against which it would be neither desirable nor wise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to struggle--I should often have had occasion in this book to address,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,language of such severity to those democratic communities which this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolution has brought into being. My answer is simply, that it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"because I am not an adversary of democracy, that I have sought to speak","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democracy in all sincerity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men will not accept truth at the hands of their enemies, and truth is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seldom offered to them by their friends: for this reason I have spoken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. I was persuaded that many would take upon themselves to announce the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"new blessings which the principle of equality promises to mankind, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that few would dare to point out from afar the dangers with which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it threatens them. To those perils therefore I have turned my chief,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attention, and believing that I had discovered them clearly, I have not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had the cowardice to leave them untold.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I trust that my readers will find in this Second Part that impartiality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which seems to have been remarked in the former work. Placed as I am in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the midst of the conflicting opinions between which we are divided,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have endeavored to suppress within me for a time the favorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sympathies or the adverse emotions with which each of them inspires,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,me. If those who read this book can find a single sentence intended to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"flatter any of the great parties which have agitated my country, or any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those petty factions which now harass and weaken it, let such readers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,raise their voices to accuse me.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The subject I have sought to embrace is immense, for it includes the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greater part of the feelings and opinions to which the new state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society has given birth. Such a subject is doubtless above my strength,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and in treating it I have not succeeded in satisfying myself. But, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have not been able to reach the goal which I had in view, my readers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will at least do me the justice to acknowledge that I have conceived and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter I: Philosophical Method Among the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,paid to philosophy than in the United States. The Americans have no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,philosophical school of their own; and they care but little for all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the schools into which Europe is divided, the very names of which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,scarcely known to them. Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,form;--such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophical method of the Americans. But if I go further, and if I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seek amongst these characteristics that which predominates over and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"includes almost all the rest, I discover that in most of the operations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understanding alone. America is therefore one of the countries in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world where philosophy is least studied, and where the precepts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Descartes are best applied. Nor is this surprising. The Americans do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"read the works of Descartes, because their social condition deters them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from speculative studies; but they follow his maxims because this very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,social condition naturally disposes their understanding to adopt them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the midst of the continual movement which agitates a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, the tie which unites one generation to another is relaxed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or broken; every man readily loses the trace of the ideas of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forefathers or takes no care about them. Nor can men living in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,state of society derive their belief from the opinions of the class to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they belong, for, so to speak, there are no longer any classes, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those which still exist are composed of such mobile elements, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their body can never exercise a real control over its members. As to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influence which the intelligence of one man has on that of another, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must necessarily be very limited in a country where the citizens, placed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on the footing of a general similitude, are all closely seen by each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other; and where, as no signs of incontestable greatness or superiority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are perceived in any one of them, they are constantly brought back to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own reason as the most obvious and proximate source of truth. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not only confidence in this or that man which is then destroyed, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the taste for trusting the ipse dixit of any man whatsoever. Everyone,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shuts himself up in his own breast, and affects from that point to judge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The practice which obtains amongst the Americans of fixing the standard,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of their judgment in themselves alone, leads them to other habits of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind. As they perceive that they succeed in resolving without assistance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the little difficulties which their practical life presents, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"readily conclude that everything in the world may be explained, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing in it transcends the limits of the understanding. Thus they fall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to denying what they cannot comprehend; which leaves them but little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"faith for whatever is extraordinary, and an almost insurmountable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distaste for whatever is supernatural. As it is on their own testimony,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that they are accustomed to rely, they like to discern the object which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engages their attention with extreme clearness; they therefore strip off,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as much as possible all that covers it, they rid themselves of whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"separates them from it, they remove whatever conceals it from sight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in order to view it more closely and in the broad light of day. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disposition of the mind soon leads them to contemn forms, which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,regard as useless and inconvenient veils placed between them and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,truth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans then have not required to extract their philosophical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,method from books; they have found it in themselves. The same thing may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be remarked in what has taken place in Europe. This same method has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only been established and made popular in Europe in proportion as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of society has become more equal, and men have grown more like","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other. Let us consider for a moment the connection of the periods,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in which this change may be traced. In the sixteenth century the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Reformers subjected some of the dogmas of the ancient faith to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,scrutiny of private judgment; but they still withheld from it the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"judgment of all the rest. In the seventeenth century, Bacon in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"natural sciences, and Descartes in the study of philosophy in the strict","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sense of the term, abolished recognized formulas, destroyed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"empire of tradition, and overthrew the authority of the schools. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophers of the eighteenth century, generalizing at length the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle, undertook to submit to the private judgment of each man all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the objects of his belief.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Who does not perceive that Luther, Descartes, and Voltaire employed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same method, and that they differed only in the greater or less use","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which they professed should be made of it? Why did the Reformers confine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves so closely within the circle of religious ideas? Why did,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Descartes, choosing only to apply his method to certain matters, though","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he had made it fit to be applied to all, declare that men might judge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for themselves in matters philosophical but not in matters political?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,How happened it that in the eighteenth century those general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applications were all at once drawn from this same method, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Descartes and his predecessors had either not perceived or had rejected?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"To what, lastly, is the fact to be attributed, that at this period","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the method we are speaking of suddenly emerged from the schools, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,penetrate into society and become the common standard of intelligence;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and that, after it had become popular among the French, it has been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ostensibly adopted or secretly followed by all the nations of Europe?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The philosophical method here designated may have been engendered in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sixteenth century--it may have been more accurately defined and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extensively applied in the seventeenth; but neither in the one nor in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other could it be commonly adopted. Political laws, the condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of society, and the habits of mind which are derived from these causes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were as yet opposed to it. It was discovered at a time when men were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,beginning to equalize and assimilate their conditions. It could only be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,generally followed in ages when those conditions had at length become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nearly equal, and men nearly alike.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The philosophical method of the eighteenth century is then not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"French, but it is democratic; and this explains why it was so readily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"admitted throughout Europe, where it has contributed so powerfully to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,change the face of society. It is not because the French have changed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their former opinions, and altered their former manners, that they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,convulsed the world; but because they were the first to generalize and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bring to light a philosophical method, by the assistance of which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"became easy to attack all that was old, and to open a path to all that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was new.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If it be asked why, at the present day, this same method is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rigorously followed and more frequently applied by the French than by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Americans, although the principle of equality be no less complete,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and of more ancient date, amongst the latter people, the fact may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attributed to two circumstances, which it is essential to have clearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understood in the first instance. It must never be forgotten that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religion gave birth to Anglo-American society. In the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religion is therefore commingled with all the habits of the nation and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the feelings of patriotism; whence it derives a peculiar force.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,To this powerful reason another of no less intensity may be added: in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"American religion has, as it were, laid down its own limits. Religious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"institutions have remained wholly distinct from political institutions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,so that former laws have been easily changed whilst former belief has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remained unshaken. Christianity has therefore retained a strong hold on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the public mind in America; and, I would more particularly remark, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its sway is not only that of a philosophical doctrine which has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adopted upon inquiry, but of a religion which is believed without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discussion. In the United States Christian sects are infinitely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,diversified and perpetually modified; but Christianity itself is a fact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so irresistibly established, that no one undertakes either to attack or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to defend it. The Americans, having admitted the principal doctrines of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Christian religion without inquiry, are obliged to accept in like","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner a great number of moral truths originating in it and connected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with it. Hence the activity of individual analysis is restrained within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"narrow limits, and many of the most important of human opinions are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,removed from the range of its influence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The second circumstance to which I have alluded is the following: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"social condition and the constitution of the Americans are democratic,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but they have not had a democratic revolution. They arrived upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,soil they occupy in nearly the condition in which we see them at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,present day; and this is of very considerable importance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"There are no revolutions which do not shake existing belief, enervate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"authority, and throw doubts over commonly received ideas. The effect of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all revolutions is therefore, more or less, to surrender men to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own guidance, and to open to the mind of every man a void and almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unlimited range of speculation. When equality of conditions succeeds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a protracted conflict between the different classes of which the elder,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society was composed, envy, hatred, and uncharitableness, pride, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exaggerated self-confidence are apt to seize upon the human heart,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and plant their sway there for a time. This, independently of equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"itself, tends powerfully to divide men--to lead them to mistrust the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"judgment of others, and to seek the light of truth nowhere but in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own understandings. Everyone then attempts to be his own sufficient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"guide, and makes it his boast to form his own opinions on all subjects.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men are no longer bound together by ideas, but by interests; and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would seem as if human opinions were reduced to a sort of intellectual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dust, scattered on every side, unable to collect, unable to cohere.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, that independence of mind which equality supposes to exist, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"never so great, nor ever appears so excessive, as at the time when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality is beginning to establish itself, and in the course of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,painful labor by which it is established. That sort of intellectual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freedom which equality may give ought, therefore, to be very carefully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distinguished from the anarchy which revolution brings. Each of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"two things must be severally considered, in order not to conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exaggerated hopes or fears of the future.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe that the men who will live under the new forms of society will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,make frequent use of their private judgment; but I am far from thinking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they will often abuse it. This is attributable to a cause of more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general application to all democratic countries, and which, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"long run, must needs restrain in them the independence of individual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speculation within fixed, and sometimes narrow, limits. I shall proceed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to point out this cause in the next chapter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter II: Of The Principal Source Of Belief Among Democratic Nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,At different periods dogmatical belief is more or less abundant. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arises in different ways, and it may change its object or its form; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"under no circumstances will dogmatical belief cease to exist, or, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other words, men will never cease to entertain some implicit opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without trying them by actual discussion. If everyone undertook to form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his own opinions and to seek for truth by isolated paths struck out by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself alone, it is not to be supposed that any considerable number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men would ever unite in any common belief. But obviously without such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common belief no society can prosper--say rather no society can subsist;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for without ideas held in common, there is no common action, and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common action, there may still be men, but there is no social body. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order that society should exist, and, a fortiori, that a society should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prosper, it is required that all the minds of the citizens should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rallied and held together by certain predominant ideas; and this cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be the case, unless each of them sometimes draws his opinions from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common source, and consents to accept certain matters of belief at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hands of the community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If I now consider man in his isolated capacity, I find that dogmatical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief is not less indispensable to him in order to live alone, than it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is to enable him to co-operate with his fellow-creatures. If man were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forced to demonstrate to himself all the truths of which he makes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"daily use, his task would never end. He would exhaust his strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in preparatory exercises, without advancing beyond them. As, from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shortness of his life, he has not the time, nor, from the limits of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intelligence, the capacity, to accomplish this, he is reduced to take","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon trust a number of facts and opinions which he has not had either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the time or the power to verify himself, but which men of greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ability have sought out, or which the world adopts. On this groundwork","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he raises for himself the structure of his own thoughts; nor is he led,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to proceed in this manner by choice so much as he is constrained by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inflexible law of his condition. There is no philosopher of such great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"parts in the world, but that he believes a million of things on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"faith of other people, and supposes a great many more truths than he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demonstrates. This is not only necessary but desirable. A man who should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertake to inquire into everything for himself, could devote to each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thing but little time and attention. His task would keep his mind in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetual unrest, which would prevent him from penetrating to the depth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of any truth, or of grappling his mind indissolubly to any conviction.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,His intellect would be at once independent and powerless. He must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore make his choice from amongst the various objects of human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief, and he must adopt many opinions without discussion, in order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to search the better into that smaller number which he sets apart for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,investigation. It is true that whoever receives an opinion on the word,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of another, does so far enslave his mind; but it is a salutary servitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which allows him to make a good use of freedom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A principle of authority must then always occur, under all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"circumstances, in some part or other of the moral and intellectual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world. Its place is variable, but a place it necessarily has. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence of individual minds may be greater, or it may be less:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unbounded it cannot be. Thus the question is, not to know whether any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intellectual authority exists in the ages of democracy, but simply where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it resides and by what standard it is to be measured.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have shown in the preceding chapter how the equality of conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leads men to entertain a sort of instinctive incredulity of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supernatural, and a very lofty and often exaggerated opinion of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human understanding. The men who live at a period of social equality are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not therefore easily led to place that intellectual authority to which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they bow either beyond or above humanity. They commonly seek for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sources of truth in themselves, or in those who are like themselves.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This would be enough to prove that at such periods no new religion could,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be established, and that all schemes for such a purpose would be not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only impious but absurd and irrational. It may be foreseen that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic people will not easily give credence to divine missions; that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they will turn modern prophets to a ready jest; and they that will seek,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to discover the chief arbiter of their belief within, and not beyond,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the limits of their kind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the ranks of society are unequal, and men unlike each other in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition, there are some individuals invested with all the power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superior intelligence, learning, and enlightenment, whilst the multitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is sunk in ignorance and prejudice. Men living at these aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,periods are therefore naturally induced to shape their opinions by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superior standard of a person or a class of persons, whilst they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,averse to recognize the infallibility of the mass of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The contrary takes place in ages of equality. The nearer the citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are drawn to the common level of an equal and similar condition, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less prone does each man become to place implicit faith in a certain man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or a certain class of men. But his readiness to believe the multitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increases, and opinion is more than ever mistress of the world. Not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is common opinion the only guide which private judgment retains amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people, but amongst such a people it possesses a power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infinitely beyond what it has elsewhere. At periods of equality men have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no faith in one another, by reason of their common resemblance; but this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very resemblance gives them almost unbounded confidence in the judgment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the public; for it would not seem probable, as they are all endowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with equal means of judging, but that the greater truth should go with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the greater number.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the inhabitant of a democratic country compares himself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individually with all those about him, he feels with pride that he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the equal of any one of them; but when he comes to survey the totality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his fellows, and to place himself in contrast to so huge a body,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he is instantly overwhelmed by the sense of his own insignificance and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weakness. The same equality which renders him independent of each of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-citizens taken severally, exposes him alone and unprotected to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the influence of the greater number. The public has therefore among a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people a singular power, of which aristocratic nations could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never so much as conceive an idea; for it does not persuade to certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions, but it enforces them, and infuses them into the faculties by a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sort of enormous pressure of the minds of all upon the reason of each.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States the majority undertakes to supply a multitude of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ready-made opinions for the use of individuals, who are thus relieved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the necessity of forming opinions of their own. Everybody there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adopts great numbers of theories, on philosophy, morals, and politics,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without inquiry, upon public trust; and if we look to it very narrowly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it will be perceived that religion herself holds her sway there, much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less as a doctrine of revelation than as a commonly received opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The fact that the political laws of the Americans are such that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"majority rules the community with sovereign sway, materially increases","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the power which that majority naturally exercises over the mind. For,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing is more customary in man than to recognize superior wisdom in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the person of his oppressor. This political omnipotence of the majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the United States doubtless augments the influence which public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion would obtain without it over the mind of each member of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community; but the foundations of that influence do not rest upon it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They must be sought for in the principle of equality itself, not in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more or less popular institutions which men living under that condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may give themselves. The intellectual dominion of the greater number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would probably be less absolute amongst a democratic people governed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by a king than in the sphere of a pure democracy, but it will always be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extremely absolute; and by whatever political laws men are governed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the ages of equality, it may be foreseen that faith in public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinion will become a species of religion there, and the majority its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ministering prophet.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus intellectual authority will be different, but it will not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diminished; and far from thinking that it will disappear, I augur that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it may readily acquire too much preponderance, and confine the action","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of private judgment within narrower limits than are suited either to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the greatness or the happiness of the human race. In the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality I very clearly discern two tendencies; the one leading the mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of every man to untried thoughts, the other inclined to prohibit him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from thinking at all. And I perceive how, under the dominion of certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"laws, democracy would extinguish that liberty of the mind to which a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic social condition is favorable; so that, after having broken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the bondage once imposed on it by ranks or by men, the human mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would be closely fettered to the general will of the greatest number.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If the absolute power of the majority were to be substituted by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations, for all the different powers which checked or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"retarded overmuch the energy of individual minds, the evil would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only have changed its symptoms. Men would not have found the means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independent life; they would simply have invented (no easy task) a new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dress for servitude. There is--and I cannot repeat it too often--there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is in this matter for profound reflection for those who look on freedom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as a holy thing, and who hate not only the despot, but despotism. For","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow, I care but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little to know who oppresses me; and I am not the more disposed to pass,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beneath the yoke, because it is held out to me by the arms of a million","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter III: Why The Americans Display More Readiness And More Taste For,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"General Ideas Than Their Forefathers, The English.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Deity does not regard the human race collectively. He surveys at one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"glance and severally all the beings of whom mankind is composed, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discerns in each man the resemblances which assimilate him to all his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellows, and the differences which distinguish him from them. God,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore, stands in no need of general ideas; that is to say, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never sensible of the necessity of collecting a considerable number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of analogous objects under the same form for greater convenience in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thinking. Such is, however, not the case with man. If the human mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were to attempt to examine and pass a judgment on all the individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cases before it, the immensity of detail would soon lead it astray","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and bewilder its discernment: in this strait, man has recourse to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an imperfect but necessary expedient, which at once assists and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demonstrates his weakness. Having superficially considered a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of objects, and remarked their resemblance, he assigns to them a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common name, sets them apart, and proceeds onwards.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"General ideas are no proof of the strength, but rather of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insufficiency of the human intellect; for there are in nature no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beings exactly alike, no things precisely identical, nor any rules","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indiscriminately and alike applicable to several objects at once. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chief merit of general ideas is, that they enable the human mind to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pass a rapid judgment on a great many objects at once; but, on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand, the notions they convey are never otherwise than incomplete, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they always cause the mind to lose as much in accuracy as it gains,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in comprehensiveness. As social bodies advance in civilization, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquire the knowledge of new facts, and they daily lay hold almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unconsciously of some particular truths. The more truths of this kind a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man apprehends, the more general ideas is he naturally led to conceive.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A multitude of particular facts cannot be seen separately, without at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,last discovering the common tie which connects them. Several individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lead to the perception of the species; several species to that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,genus. Hence the habit and the taste for general ideas will always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be greatest amongst a people of ancient cultivation and extensive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,knowledge.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But there are other reasons which impel men to generalize their ideas,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or which restrain them from it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans are much more addicted to the use of general ideas than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the English, and entertain a much greater relish for them: this appears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very singular at first sight, when it is remembered that the two nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have the same origin, that they lived for centuries under the same laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and that they still incessantly interchange their opinions and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners. This contrast becomes much more striking still, if we fix our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eyes on our own part of the world, and compare together the two most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enlightened nations which inhabit it. It would seem as if the mind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the English could only tear itself reluctantly and painfully away from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the observation of particular facts, to rise from them to their causes;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and that it only generalizes in spite of itself. Amongst the French, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contrary, the taste for general ideas would seem to have grown to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so ardent a passion, that it must be satisfied on every occasion. I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"informed, every morning when I wake, that some general and eternal law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has just been discovered, which I never heard mentioned before. There is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not a mediocre scribbler who does not try his hand at discovering truths,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applicable to a great kingdom, and who is very ill pleased with himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,if he does not succeed in compressing the human race into the compass,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an article. So great a dissimilarity between two very enlightened,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations surprises me. If I again turn my attention to England, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"observe the events which have occurred there in the last half-century,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think I may affirm that a taste for general ideas increases in that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country in proportion as its ancient constitution is weakened.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The state of civilization is therefore insufficient by itself to explain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"what suggests to the human mind the love of general ideas, or diverts it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from them. When the conditions of men are very unequal, and inequality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"itself is the permanent state of society, individual men gradually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become so dissimilar that each class assumes the aspect of a distinct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,race: only one of these classes is ever in view at the same instant; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,losing sight of that general tie which binds them all within the vast,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bosom of mankind, the observation invariably rests not on man, but on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain men. Those who live in this aristocratic state of society never,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore, conceive very general ideas respecting themselves, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is enough to imbue them with an habitual distrust of such ideas, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an instinctive aversion of them. He, on the contrary, who inhabits a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic country, sees around him, one very hand, men differing but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little from each other; he cannot turn his mind to any one portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mankind, without expanding and dilating his thought till it embrace the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whole. All the truths which are applicable to himself, appear to him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equally and similarly applicable to each of his fellow-citizens and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fellow-men. Having contracted the habit of generalizing his ideas in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the study which engages him most, and interests him more than others,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he transfers the same habit to all his pursuits; and thus it is that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the craving to discover general laws in everything, to include a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of objects under the same formula, and to explain a mass of facts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by a single cause, becomes an ardent, and sometimes an undiscerning,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passion in the human mind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nothing shows the truth of this proposition more clearly than the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions of the ancients respecting their slaves. The most profound and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"capacious minds of Rome and Greece were never able to reach the idea, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"once so general and so simple, of the common likeness of men, and of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common birthright of each to freedom: they strove to prove that slavery,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"was in the order of nature, and that it would always exist. Nay, more,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everything shows that those of the ancients who had passed from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servile to the free condition, many of whom have left us excellent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"writings, did themselves regard servitude in no other light.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All the great writers of antiquity belonged to the aristocracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of masters, or at least they saw that aristocracy established and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uncontested before their eyes. Their mind, after it had expanded itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in several directions, was barred from further progress in this one; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the advent of Jesus Christ upon earth was required to teach that all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of the human race are by nature equal and alike.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the ages of equality all men are independent of each other, isolated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and weak. The movements of the multitude are not permanently guided,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the will of any individuals; at such times humanity seems always to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advance of itself. In order, therefore, to explain what is passing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world, man is driven to seek for some great causes, which, acting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the same manner on all our fellow-creatures, thus impel them all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,involuntarily to pursue the same track. This again naturally leads the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"human mind to conceive general ideas, and superinduces a taste for them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have already shown in what way the equality of conditions leads every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man to investigate truths for himself. It may readily be perceived that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a method of this kind must insensibly beget a tendency to general ideas,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the human mind. When I repudiate the traditions of rank, profession,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and birth; when I escape from the authority of example, to seek out, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the single effort of my reason, the path to be followed, I am inclined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to derive the motives of my opinions from human nature itself; which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leads me necessarily, and almost unconsciously, to adopt a great number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of very general notions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All that I have here said explains the reasons for which the English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,display much less readiness and taste or the generalization of ideas,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than their American progeny, and still less again than their French","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neighbors; and likewise the reason for which the English of the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,day display more of these qualities than their forefathers did. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,English have long been a very enlightened and a very aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation; their enlightened condition urged them constantly to generalize,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and their aristocratic habits confined them to particularize. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arose that philosophy, at once bold and timid, broad and narrow,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which has hitherto prevailed in England, and which still obstructs and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stagnates in so many minds in that country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Independently of the causes I have pointed out in what goes before,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others may be discerned less apparent, but no less efficacious, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engender amongst almost every democratic people a taste, and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a passion, for general ideas. An accurate distinction must be taken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between ideas of this kind. Some are the result of slow, minute, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conscientious labor of the mind, and these extend the sphere of human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,knowledge; others spring up at once from the first rapid exercise of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wits, and beget none but very superficial and very uncertain notions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Men who live in ages of equality have a great deal of curiosity and very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"little leisure; their life is so practical, so confused, so excited, so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"active, that but little time remains to them for thought. Such men are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prone to general ideas because they spare them the trouble of studying,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"particulars; they contain, if I may so speak, a great deal in a little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"compass, and give, in a little time, a great return. If then, upon a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brief and inattentive investigation, a common relation is thought to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"detected between certain obtects, inquiry is not pushed any further; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without examining in detail how far these different objects differ or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"agree, they are hastily arranged under one formulary, in order to pass","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to another subject.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,One of the distinguishing characteristics of a democratic period is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taste all men have at such ties for easy success and present enjoyment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This occurs in the pursuits of the intellect as well as in all others.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Most of those who live at a time of equality are full of an ambition at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,once aspiring and relaxed: they would fain succeed brilliantly and at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"once, but they would be dispensed from great efforts to obtain success.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These conflicting tendencies lead straight to the research of general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas, by aid of which they flatter themselves that they can figure very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"importantly at a small expense, and draw the attention of the public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with very little trouble. And I know not whether they be wrong in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thinking thus. For their readers are as much averse to investigating,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,anything to the bottom as they can be themselves; and what is generally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sought in the productions of the mind is easy pleasure and information,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without labor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If aristocratic nations do not make sufficient use of general ideas,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and frequently treat them with inconsiderate disdain, it is true, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other hand, that a democratic people is ever ready to carry ideas of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this kind to excess, and to espouse the with injudicious warmth.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IV: Why The Americans Have Never Been So Eager As The French For,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,General Ideas In Political Matters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I observed in the last chapter, that the Americans show a less decided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taste for general ideas than the French; this is more especially true in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political matters. Although the Americans infuse into their legislation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"infinitely more general ideas than the English, and although they pay","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much more attention than the latter people to the adjustment of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"practice of affairs to theory, no political bodies in the United","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States have ever shown so warm an attachment to general ideas as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Constituent Assembly and the Convention in France. At no time has the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American people laid hold on ideas of this kind with the passionate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"energy of the French people in the eighteenth century, or displayed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same blind confidence in the value and absolute truth of any theory.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This difference between the Americans and the French originates in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"several causes, but principally in the following one. The Americans form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people, which has always itself directed public affairs.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The French are a democratic people, who, for a long time, could only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,speculate on the best manner of conducting them. The social condition of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,France led that people to conceive very general ideas on the subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of government, whilst its political constitution prevented it from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"correcting those ideas by experiment, and from gradually detecting their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insufficiency; whereas in America the two things constantly balance and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,correct each other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It may seem, at first sight, that this is very much opposed to what I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have said before, that democratic nations derive their love of theory","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the excitement of their active life. A more attentive examination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will show that there is nothing contradictory in the proposition. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,living in democratic countries eagerly lay hold of general ideas because,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they have but little leisure, and because these ideas spare them the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,trouble of studying particulars. This is true; but it is only to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understood to apply to those matters which are not the necessary and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habitual subjects of their thoughts. Mercantile men will take up very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eagerly, and without any very close scrutiny, all the general ideas on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophy, politics, science, or the arts, which may be presented to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them; but for such as relate to commerce, they will not receive them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without inquiry, or adopt them without reserve. The same thing applies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to statesmen with regard to general ideas in politics. If, then, there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be a subject upon which a democratic people is peculiarly liable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abandon itself, blindly and extravagantly, to general ideas, the best","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,corrective that can be used will be to make that subject a part of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the daily practical occupation of that people. The people will then be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"compelled to enter upon its details, and the details will teach them the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"weak points of the theory. This remedy may frequently be a painful one,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but its effect is certain.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus it happens, that the democratic institutions which compel every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizen to take a practical part in the government, moderate that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,excessive taste for general theories in politics which the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality suggests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter V: Of The Manner In Which Religion In The United States Avails,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Itself Of Democratic Tendencies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have laid it down in a preceding chapter that men cannot do without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dogmatical belief; and even that it is very much to be desired that such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief should exist amongst them. I now add, that of all the kinds of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dogmatical belief the most desirable appears to me to be dogmatical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief in matters of religion; and this is a very clear inference, even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from no higher consideration than the interests of this world. There is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hardly any human action, however particular a character be assigned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to it, which does not originate in some very general idea men have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conceived of the Deity, of his relation to mankind, of the nature of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own souls, and of their duties to their fellow-creatures. Nor can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,anything prevent these ideas from being the common spring from which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everything else emanates. Men are therefore immeasurably interested in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquiring fixed ideas of God, of the soul, and of their common duties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to their Creator and to their fellow-men; for doubt on these first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principles would abandon all their actions to the impulse of chance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and would condemn them to live, to a certain extent, powerless and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,undisciplined.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This is then the subject on which it is most important for each of us to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entertain fixed ideas; and unhappily it is also the subject on which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it is most difficult for each of us, left to himself, to settle his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions by the sole force of his reason. None but minds singularly free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the ordinary anxieties of life--minds at once penetrating, subtle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and trained by thinking--can even with the assistance of much time and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"care, sound the depth of these most necessary truths. And, indeed, we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,see that these philosophers are themselves almost always enshrouded in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uncertainties; that at every step the natural light which illuminates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their path grows dimmer and less secure; and that, in spite of all their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"efforts, they have as yet only discovered a small number of conflicting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notions, on which the mind of man has been tossed about for thousands of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"years, without either laying a firmer grasp on truth, or finding novelty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,even in its errors. Studies of this nature are far above the average,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,capacity of men; and even if the majority of mankind were capable of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such pursuits, it is evident that leisure to cultivate them would still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be wanting. Fixed ideas of God and human nature are indispensable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,daily practice of men's lives; but the practice of their lives prevents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them from acquiring such ideas.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The difficulty appears to me to be without a parallel. Amongst the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sciences there are some which are useful to the mass of mankind, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are within its reach; others can only be approached by the few,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and are not cultivated by the many, who require nothing beyond their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more remote applications: but the daily practice of the science I speak,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of is indispensable to all, although the study of it is inaccessible to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the far greater number.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,General ideas respecting God and human nature are therefore the ideas,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,above all others which it is most suitable to withdraw from the habitual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"action of private judgment, and in which there is most to gain and least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to lose by recognizing a principle of authority. The first object and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one of the principal advantages of religions, is to furnish to each of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these fundamental questions a solution which is at once clear, precise,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intelligible to the mass of mankind, and lasting. There are religions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are very false and very absurd; but it may be affirmed, that any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"religion which remains within the circle I have just traced, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aspiring to go beyond it (as many religions have attempted to do, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the purpose of enclosing on every side the free progress of the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind), imposes a salutary restraint on the intellect; and it must be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"admitted that, if it do not save men in another world, such religion is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at least very conducive to their happiness and their greatness in this.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This is more especially true of men living in free countries. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the religion of a people is destroyed, doubt gets hold of the highest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"portions of the intellect, and half paralyzes all the rest of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,powers. Every man accustoms himself to entertain none but confused,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and changing notions on the subjects most interesting to his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fellow-creatures and himself. His opinions are ill-defended and easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abandoned: and, despairing of ever resolving by himself the hardest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"problems of the destiny of man, he ignobly submits to think no more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"about them. Such a condition cannot but enervate the soul, relax the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"springs of the will, and prepare a people for servitude. Nor does it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only happen, in such a case, that they allow their freedom to be wrested","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from them; they frequently themselves surrender it. When there is no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,longer any principle of authority in religion any more than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"politics, men are speedily frightened at the aspect of this unbounded","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence. The constant agitation of all surrounding things alarms,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and exhausts them. As everything is at sea in the sphere of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intellect, they determine at least that the mechanism of society should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be firm and fixed; and as they cannot resume their ancient belief, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assume a master.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"For my own part, I doubt whether man can ever support at the same time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,complete religious independence and entire public freedom. And I am,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inclined to think, that if faith be wanting in him, he must serve; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"if he be free, he must believe.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Perhaps, however, this great utility of religions is still more obvious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst nations where equality of conditions prevails than amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others. It must be acknowledged that equality, which brings great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"benefits into the world, nevertheless suggests to men (as will be shown","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hereafter) some very dangerous propensities. It tends to isolate them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from each other, to concentrate every man's attention upon himself; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it lays open the soul to an inordinate love of material gratification.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The greatest advantage of religion is to inspire diametrically contrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principles. There is no religion which does not place the object of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man's desires above and beyond the treasures of earth, and which does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not naturally raise his soul to regions far above those of the senses.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nor is there any which does not impose on man some sort of duties to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his kind, and thus draws him at times from the contemplation of himself.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This occurs in religions the most false and dangerous. Religious nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are therefore naturally strong on the very point on which democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations are weak; which shows of what importance it is for men to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,preserve their religion as their conditions become more equal.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have neither the right nor the intention of examining the supernatural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,means which God employs to infuse religious belief into the heart of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man. I am at this moment considering religions in a purely human point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of view: my object is to inquire by what means they may most easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,retain their sway in the democratic ages upon which we are entering. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has been shown that, at times of general cultivation and equality,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the human mind does not consent to adopt dogmatical opinions without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reluctance, and feels their necessity acutely in spiritual matters only.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This proves, in the first place, that at such times religions ought,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more cautiously than at any other, to confine themselves within their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own precincts; for in seeking to extend their power beyond religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"matters, they incur a risk of not being believed at all. The circle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,within which they seek to bound the human intellect ought therefore to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be carefully traced, and beyond its verge the mind should be left in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entire freedom to its own guidance. Mahommed professed to derive from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Heaven, and he has inserted in the Koran, not only a body of religious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"doctrines, but political maxims, civil and criminal laws, and theories","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of science. The gospel, on the contrary, only speaks of the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,relations of men to God and to each other--beyond which it inculcates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and imposes no point of faith. This alone, besides a thousand other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reasons, would suffice to prove that the former of these religions will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"never long predominate in a cultivated and democratic age, whilst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,latter is destined to retain its sway at these as at all other periods.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But in continuation of this branch of the subject, I find that in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order for religions to maintain their authority, humanly speaking, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages, they must not only confine themselves strictly within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the circle of spiritual matters: their power also depends very much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on the nature of the belief they inculcate, on the external forms they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assume, and on the obligations they impose. The preceding observation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that equality leads men to very general and very extensive notions, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principally to be understood as applied to the question of religion. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,living in a similar and equal condition in the world readily conceive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the idea of the one God, governing every man by the same laws, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,granting to every man future happiness on the same conditions. The idea,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the unity of mankind constantly leads them back to the idea of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unity of the Creator; whilst, on the contrary, in a state of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"where men are broken up into very unequal ranks, they are apt to devise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as many deities as there are nations, castes, classes, or families, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to trace a thousand private roads to heaven.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It cannot be denied that Christianity itself has felt, to a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extent, the influence which social and political conditions exercise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on religious opinions. At the epoch at which the Christian religion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appeared upon earth, Providence, by whom the world was doubtless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prepared for its coming, had gathered a large portion of the human race,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"like an immense flock, under the sceptre of the Caesars. The men of whom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this multitude was composed were distinguished by numerous differences;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but they had thus much in common, that they all obeyed the same laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and that every subject was so weak and insignificant in relation to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imperial potentate, that all appeared equal when their condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was contrasted with his. This novel and peculiar state of mankind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessarily predisposed men to listen to the general truths which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Christianity teaches, and may serve to explain the facility and rapidity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with which they then penetrated into the human mind. The counterpart of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this state of things was exhibited after the destruction of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,empire. The Roman world being then as it were shattered into a thousand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fragments, each nation resumed its pristine individuality. An infinite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,scale of ranks very soon grew up in the bosom of these nations; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different races were more sharply defined, and each nation was divided","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by castes into several peoples. In the midst of this common effort,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which seemed to be urging human society to the greatest conceivable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amount of voluntary subdivision, Christianity did not lose sight of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the leading general ideas which it had brought into the world. But it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appeared, nevertheless, to lend itself, as much as was possible, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those new tendencies to which the fractional distribution of mankind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had given birth. Men continued to worship an only God, the Creator and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Preserver of all things; but every people, every city, and, so to speak,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every man, thought to obtain some distinct privilege, and win the favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an especial patron at the foot of the Throne of Grace. Unable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to subdivide the Deity, they multiplied and improperly enhanced the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance of the divine agents. The homage due to saints and angels,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,became an almost idolatrous worship amongst the majority of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Christian world; and apprehensions might be entertained for a moment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lest the religion of Christ should retrograde towards the superstitions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which it had subdued. It seems evident, that the more the barriers are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"removed which separate nation from nation amongst mankind, and citizen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from citizen amongst a people, the stronger is the bent of the human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind, as if by its own impulse, towards the idea of an only and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all-powerful Being, dispensing equal laws in the same manner to every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man. In democratic ages, then, it is more particularly important not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to allow the homage paid to secondary agents to be confounded with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,worship due to the Creator alone.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Another truth is no less clear--that religions ought to assume fewer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,external observances in democratic periods than at any others. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speaking of philosophical method among the Americans, I have shown that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing is more repugnant to the human mind in an age of equality than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the idea of subjection to forms. Men living at such times are impatient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of figures; to their eyes symbols appear to be the puerile artifice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which is used to conceal or to set off truths, which should more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,naturally be bared to the light of open day: they are unmoved by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ceremonial observances, and they are predisposed to attach a secondary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance to the details of public worship. Those whose care it is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,regulate the external forms of religion in a democratic age should pay,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a close attention to these natural propensities of the human mind, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order not unnecessarily to run counter to them. I firmly believe in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessity of forms, which fix the human mind in the contemplation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abstract truths, and stimulate its ardor in the pursuit of them, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they invigorate its powers of retaining them steadfastly. Nor do I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,suppose that it is possible to maintain a religion without external,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"observances; but, on the other hand, I am persuaded that, in the ages","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon which we are entering, it would be peculiarly dangerous to multiply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them beyond measure; and that they ought rather to be limited to as much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as is absolutely necessary to perpetuate the doctrine itself, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the substance of religions of which the ritual is only the form. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A religion which should become more minute, more peremptory, and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,surcharged with small observances at a time in which men are becoming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more equal, would soon find itself reduced to a band of fanatical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,zealots in the midst of an infidel people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: In all religions there are some ceremonies which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inherent in the substance of the faith itself, and in these nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should, on any account, be changed. This is especially the case with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Roman Catholicism, in which the doctrine and the form are frequently so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,closely united as to form one point of belief.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I anticipate the objection, that as all religions have general and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eternal truths for their object, they cannot thus shape themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the shifting spirit of every age without forfeiting their claim,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to certainty in the eyes of mankind. To this I reply again, that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principal opinions which constitute belief, and which theologians","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"call articles of faith, must be very carefully distinguished from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accessories connected with them. Religions are obliged to hold fast to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the former, whatever be the peculiar spirit of the age; but they should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take good care not to bind themselves in the same manner to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"latter at a time when everything is in transition, and when the mind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accustomed to the moving pageant of human affairs, reluctantly endures","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the attempt to fix it to any given point. The fixity of external and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secondary things can only afford a chance of duration when civil society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is itself fixed; under any other circumstances I hold it to be perilous.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We shall have occasion to see that, of all the passions which originate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in, or are fostered by, equality, there is one which it renders","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peculiarly intense, and which it infuses at the same time into the heart","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of every man: I mean the love of well-being. The taste for well-being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is the prominent and indelible feature of democratic ages. It may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,believed that a religion which should undertake to destroy so deep,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seated a passion, would meet its own destruction thence in the end; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,if it attempted to wean men entirely from the contemplation of the good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"things of this world, in order to devote their faculties exclusively to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the thought of another, it may be foreseen that the soul would at length","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"escape from its grasp, to plunge into the exclusive enjoyment of present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and material pleasures. The chief concern of religions is to purify,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to regulate, and to restrain the excessive and exclusive taste for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well-being which men feel at periods of equality; but they would err in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attempting to control it completely or to eradicate it. They will not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,succeed in curing men of the love of riches: but they may still persuade,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men to enrich themselves by none but honest means.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This brings me to a final consideration, which comprises, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the others. The more the conditions of men are equalized and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assimilated to each other, the more important is it for religions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst they carefully abstain from the daily turmoil of secular affairs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not needlessly to run counter to the ideas which generally prevail, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the permanent interests which exist in the mass of the people. For as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public opinion grows to be more and more evidently the first and most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"irresistible of existing powers, the religious principle has no external","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,support strong enough to enable it long to resist its attacks. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not less true of a democratic people, ruled by a despot, than in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"republic. In ages of equality, kings may often command obedience,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but the majority always commands belief: to the majority, therefore,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deference is to be paid in whatsoever is not contrary to the faith.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I showed in my former volumes how the American clergy stand aloof from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"secular affairs. This is the most obvious, but it is not the only,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,example of their self-restraint. In America religion is a distinct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sphere, in which the priest is sovereign, but out of which he takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,care never to go. Within its limits he is the master of the mind;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beyond them, he leaves men to themselves, and surrenders them to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence and instability which belong to their nature and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,age. I have seen no country in which Christianity is clothed with fewer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forms, figures, and observances than in the United States; or where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it presents more distinct, more simple, or more general notions to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind. Although the Christians of America are divided into a multitude of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sects, they all look upon their religion in the same light. This applies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to Roman Catholicism as well as to the other forms of belief. There,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are no Romish priests who show less taste for the minute individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"observances for extraordinary or peculiar means of salvation, or who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cling more to the spirit, and less to the letter of the law, than the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Roman Catholic priests of the United States. Nowhere is that doctrine of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Church, which prohibits the worship reserved to God alone from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"being offered to the saints, more clearly inculcated or more generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,followed. Yet the Roman Catholics of America are very submissive and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very sincere.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Another remark is applicable to the clergy of every communion. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American ministers of the gospel do not attempt to draw or to fix all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the thoughts of man upon the life to come; they are willing to surrender,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a portion of his heart to the cares of the present; seeming to consider,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the goods of this world as important, although as secondary, objects.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If they take no part themselves in productive labor, they are at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interested in its progression, and ready to applaud its results; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whilst they never cease to point to the other world as the great object,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the hopes and fears of the believer, they do not forbid him honestly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to court prosperity in this. Far from attempting to show that these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"things are distinct and contrary to one another, they study rather to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,find out on what point they are most nearly and closely connected.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All the American clergy know and respect the intellectual supremacy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exercised by the majority; they never sustain any but necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conflicts with it. They take no share in the altercations of parties,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but they readily adopt the general opinions of their country and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,age; and they allow themselves to be borne away without opposition in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the current of feeling and opinion by which everything around them is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"carried along. They endeavor to amend their contemporaries, but they do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not quit fellowship with them. Public opinion is therefore never hostile,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to them; it rather supports and protects them; and their belief owes its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"authority at the same time to the strength which is its own, and to that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they borrow from the opinions of the majority. Thus it is that, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respecting all democratic tendencies not absolutely contrary to herself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and by making use of several of them for her own purposes, religion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sustains an advantageous struggle with that spirit of individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence which is her most dangerous antagonist.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VI: Of The Progress Of Roman Catholicism In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America is the most democratic country in the world, and it is at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same time (according to reports worthy of belief) the country in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the Roman Catholic religion makes most progress. At first sight this is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,surprising. Two things must here be accurately distinguished: equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inclines men to wish to form their own opinions; but, on the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it imbues them with the taste and the idea of unity, simplicity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and impartiality in the power which governs society. Men living in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic ages are therefore very prone to shake off all religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,authority; but if they consent to subject themselves to any authority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of this kind, they choose at least that it should be single and uniform.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Religious powers not radiating from a common centre are naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,repugnant to their minds; and they almost as readily conceive that there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should be no religion, as that there should be several. At the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, more than in any preceding one, Roman Catholics are seen to lapse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into infidelity, and Protestants to be converted to Roman Catholicism.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If the Roman Catholic faith be considered within the pale of the church,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it would seem to be losing ground; without that pale, to be gaining it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nor is this circumstance difficult of explanation. The men of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"days are naturally disposed to believe; but, as soon as they have any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"religion, they immediately find in themselves a latent propensity which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,urges them unconsciously towards Catholicism. Many of the doctrines and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the practices of the Romish Church astonish them; but they feel a secret,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"admiration for its discipline, and its great unity attracts them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If Catholicism could at length withdraw itself from the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"animosities to which it has given rise, I have hardly any doubt but that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same spirit of the age, which appears to be so opposed to it, would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become so favorable as to admit of its great and sudden advancement.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,One of the most ordinary weaknesses of the human intellect is to seek to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reconcile contrary principles, and to purchase peace at the expense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of logic. Thus there have ever been, and will ever be, men who, after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,having submitted some portion of their religious belief to the principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of authority, will seek to exempt several other parts of their faith","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from its influence, and to keep their minds floating at random between","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,liberty and obedience. But I am inclined to believe that the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these thinkers will be less in democratic than in other ages; and that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,our posterity will tend more and more to a single division into two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"parts--some relinquishing Christianity entirely, and others returning to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the bosom of the Church of Rome.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VII: Of The Cause Of A Leaning To Pantheism Amongst Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I shall take occasion hereafter to show under what form the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,preponderating taste of a democratic people for very general ideas,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manifests itself in politics; but I would point out, at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stage of my work, its principal effect on philosophy. It cannot be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,denied that pantheism has made great progress in our age. The writings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of a part of Europe bear visible marks of it: the Germans introduce it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into philosophy, and the French into literature. Most of the works of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imagination published in France contain some opinions or some tinge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"caught from pantheistical doctrines, or they disclose some tendency to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such doctrines in their authors. This appears to me not only to proceed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from an accidental, but from a permanent cause.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the conditions of society are becoming more equal, and each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual man becomes more like all the rest, more weak and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insignificant, a habit grows up of ceasing to notice the citizens to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consider only the people, and of overlooking individuals to think only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their kind. At such times the human mind seeks to embrace a multitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of different objects at once; and it constantly strives to succeed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,connecting a variety of consequences with a single cause. The idea,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of unity so possesses itself of man, and is sought for by him so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"universally, that if he thinks he has found it, he readily yields","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself up to repose in that belief. Nor does he content himself with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the discovery that nothing is in the world but a creation and a Creator;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still embarrassed by this primary division of things, he seeks to expand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to simplify his conception by including God and the universe in one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great whole. If there be a philosophical system which teaches that all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"things material and immaterial, visible and invisible, which the world","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contains, are only to be considered as the several parts of an immense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Being, which alone remains unchanged amidst the continual change and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ceaseless transformation of all that constitutes it, we may readily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"infer that such a system, although it destroy the individuality of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man--nay, rather because it destroys that individuality--will have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secret charms for men living in democracies. All their habits of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thought prepare them to conceive it, and predispose them to adopt it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It naturally attracts and fixes their imagination; it fosters the pride,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst it soothes the indolence, of their minds. Amongst the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"systems by whose aid philosophy endeavors to explain the universe, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,believe pantheism to be one of those most fitted to seduce the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind in democratic ages. Against it all who abide in their attachment to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the true greatness of man should struggle and combine.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VIII: The Principle Of Equality Suggests To The Americans The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Idea Of The Indefinite Perfectibility Of Man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Equality suggests to the human mind several ideas which would not have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"originated from any other source, and it modifies almost all those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,previously entertained. I take as an example the idea of human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perfectibility, because it is one of the principal notions that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intellect can conceive, and because it constitutes of itself a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophical theory, which is every instant to be traced by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequences in the practice of human affairs. Although man has many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"points of resemblance with the brute creation, one characteristic is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiar to himself--he improves: they are incapable of improvement.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Mankind could not fail to discover this difference from its earliest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,period. The idea of perfectibility is therefore as old as the world;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality did not give birth to it, although it has imparted to it a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,novel character.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the citizens of a community are classed according to their rank,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their profession, or their birth, and when all men are constrained to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"follow the career which happens to open before them, everyone thinks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the utmost limits of human power are to be discerned in proximity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to himself, and none seeks any longer to resist the inevitable law of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his destiny. Not indeed that an aristocratic people absolutely contests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man's faculty of self-improvement, but they do not hold it to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indefinite; amelioration they conceive, but not change: they imagine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the future condition of society may be better, but not essentially","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different; and whilst they admit that mankind has made vast strides,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in improvement, and may still have some to make, they assign to it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,beforehand certain impassable limits. Thus they do not presume that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have arrived at the supreme good or at absolute truth (what people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or what man was ever wild enough to imagine it?) but they cherish a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persuasion that they have pretty nearly reached that degree of greatness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and knowledge which our imperfect nature admits of; and as nothing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,moves about them they are willing to fancy that everything is in its fit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,place. Then it is that the legislator affects to lay down eternal laws;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that kings and nations will raise none but imperishable monuments; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the present generation undertakes to spare generations to come the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,care of regulating their destinies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In proportion as castes disappear and the classes of society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"approximate--as manners, customs, and laws vary, from the tumultuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intercourse of men--as new facts arise--as new truths are brought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to light--as ancient opinions are dissipated, and others take their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"place--the image of an ideal perfection, forever on the wing, presents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself to the human mind. Continual changes are then every instant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occurring under the observation of every man: the position of some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is rendered worse; and he learns but too well, that no people and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no individual, how enlightened soever they may be, can lay claim to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infallibility;--the condition of others is improved; whence he infers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that man is endowed with an indefinite faculty of improvement. His,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reverses teach him that none may hope to have discovered absolute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,good--his success stimulates him to the never-ending pursuit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. Thus, forever seeking--forever falling, to rise again--often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disappointed, but not discouraged--he tends unceasingly towards that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unmeasured greatness so indistinctly visible at the end of the long,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,track which humanity has yet to tread. It can hardly be believed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,how many facts naturally flow from the philosophical theory of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indefinite perfectibility of man, or how strong an influence it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exercises even on men who, living entirely for the purposes of action","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and not of thought, seem to conform their actions to it, without knowing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"anything about it. I accost an American sailor, and I inquire why the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ships of his country are built so as to last but for a short time;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he answers without hesitation that the art of navigation is every day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"making such rapid progress, that the finest vessel would become almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"useless if it lasted beyond a certain number of years. In these words,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which fell accidentally and on a particular subject from a man of rude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attainments, I recognize the general and systematic idea upon which a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great people directs all its concerns.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Aristocratic nations are naturally too apt to narrow the scope of human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perfectibility; democratic nations to expand it beyond compass.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IX: The Example Of The Americans Does Not Prove That A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democratic People Can Have No Aptitude And No Taste For Science,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Literature, Or Art","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It must be acknowledged that amongst few of the civilized nations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,our time have the higher sciences made less progress than in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"States; and in few have great artists, fine poets, or celebrated writers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been more rare. Many Europeans, struck by this fact, have looked upon it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as a natural and inevitable result of equality; and they have supposed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that if a democratic state of society and democratic institutions were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ever to prevail over the whole earth, the human mind would gradually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"find its beacon-lights grow dim, and men would relapse into a period of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"darkness. To reason thus is, I think, to confound several ideas which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it is important to divide and to examine separately: it is to mingle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unintentionally, what is democratic with what is only American.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The religion professed by the first emigrants, and bequeathed by them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to their descendants, simple in its form of worship, austere and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost harsh in its principles, and hostile to external symbols and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ceremonial pomp, is naturally unfavorable to the fine arts, and only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,yields a reluctant sufferance to the pleasures of literature. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans are a very old and a very enlightened people, who have fallen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon a new and unbounded country, where they may extend themselves at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasure, and which they may fertilize without difficulty. This state","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of things is without a parallel in the history of the world. In America,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then, every one finds facilities, unknown elsewhere, for making or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increasing his fortune. The spirit of gain is always on the stretch, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the human mind, constantly diverted from the pleasures of imagination","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the labors of the intellect, is there swayed by no impulse but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pursuit of wealth. Not only are manufacturing and commercial classes to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be found in the United States, as they are in all other countries; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"what never occurred elsewhere, the whole community is simultaneously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engaged in productive industry and commerce. I am convinced that, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Americans had been alone in the world, with the freedom and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knowledge acquired by their forefathers, and the passions which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own, they would not have been slow to discover that progress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot long be made in the application of the sciences without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cultivating the theory of them; that all the arts are perfected by one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"another: and, however absorbed they might have been by the pursuit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the principal object of their desires, they would speedily have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"admitted, that it is necessary to turn aside from it occasionally, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order the better to attain it in the end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The taste for the pleasures of the mind is moreover so natural to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"heart of civilized man, that amongst the polite nations, which are least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disposed to give themselves up to these pursuits, a certain number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizens are always to be found who take part in them. This intellectual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"craving, when once felt, would very soon have been satisfied. But at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very time when the Americans were naturally inclined to require nothing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of science but its special applications to the useful arts and the means,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of rendering life comfortable, learned and literary Europe was engaged","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in exploring the common sources of truth, and in improving at the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time all that can minister to the pleasures or satisfy the wants of man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,At the head of the enlightened nations of the Old World the inhabitants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the United States more particularly distinguished one, to which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were closely united by a common origin and by kindred habits. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this people they found distinguished men of science, artists of skill,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"writers of eminence, and they were enabled to enjoy the treasures of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellect without requiring to labor in amassing them. I cannot consent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to separate America from Europe, in spite of the ocean which intervenes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"World; whilst the rest of the nation, enjoying more leisure and less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind. The position of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strictly Puritanical origin--their exclusively commercial habits--even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuit of science, literature, and the arts--the proximity of Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"barbarism--a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,point out the most important--have singularly concurred to fix the mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"native of the United States earthward: his religion alone bids him turn,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cease then to view all democratic nations under the mask of the American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people, and let us attempt to survey them at length with their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proper features.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is possible to conceive a people not subdivided into any castes or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"scale of ranks; in which the law, recognizing no privileges, should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"divide inherited property into equal shares; but which, at the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, should be without knowledge and without freedom. Nor is this an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,empty hypothesis: a despot may find that it is his interest to render,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his subjects equal and to leave them ignorant, in order more easily to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,keep them slaves. Not only would a democratic people of this kind show,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"neither aptitude nor taste for science, literature, or art, but it would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,probably never arrive at the possession of them. The law of descent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would of itself provide for the destruction of fortunes at each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,succeeding generation; and new fortunes would be acquired by none. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"poor man, without either knowledge or freedom, would not so much as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceive the idea of raising himself to wealth; and the rich man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"would allow himself to be degraded to poverty, without a notion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,self-defence. Between these two members of the community complete and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,invincible equality would soon be established.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,No one would then have time or taste to devote himself to the pursuits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or pleasures of the intellect; but all men would remain paralyzed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a state of common ignorance and equal servitude. When I conceive a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic society of this kind, I fancy myself in one of those low,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"close, and gloomy abodes, where the light which breaks in from without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soon faints and fades away. A sudden heaviness overpowers me, and I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"grope through the surrounding darkness, to find the aperture which will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,restore me to daylight and the air.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But all this is not applicable to men already enlightened who retain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their freedom, after having abolished from amongst them those peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and hereditary rights which perpetuated the tenure of property in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hands of certain individuals or certain bodies. When men living in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic state of society are enlightened, they readily discover that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are confined and fixed within no limits which constrain them to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take up with their present fortune. They all therefore conceive the idea,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of increasing it; if they are free, they all attempt it, but all do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not succeed in the same manner. The legislature, it is true, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"longer grants privileges, but they are bestowed by nature. As natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inequality is very great, fortunes become unequal as soon as every man","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exerts all his faculties to get rich. The law of descent prevents the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,establishment of wealthy families; but it does not prevent the existence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of wealthy individuals. It constantly brings back the members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community to a common level, from which they as constantly escape:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the inequality of fortunes augments in proportion as knowledge is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,diffused and liberty increased.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A sect which arose in our time, and was celebrated for its talents and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its extravagance, proposed to concentrate all property into the hands of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a central power, whose function it should afterwards be to parcel it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"out to individuals, according to their capacity. This would have been a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,method of escaping from that complete and eternal equality which seems,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to threaten democratic society. But it would be a simpler and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangerous remedy to grant no privilege to any, giving to all equal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cultivation and equal independence, and leaving everyone to determine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his own position. Natural inequality will very soon make way for itself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and wealth will spontaneously pass into the hands of the most capable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Free and democratic communities, then, will always contain a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,considerable number of people enjoying opulence or competency. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wealthy will not be so closely linked to each other as the members of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the former aristocratic class of society: their propensities will be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different, and they will scarcely ever enjoy leisure as secure or as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,complete: but they will be far more numerous than those who belonged to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that class of society could ever be. These persons will not be strictly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confined to the cares of practical life, and they will still be able,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"though in different degrees, to indulge in the pursuits and pleasures of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the intellect. In those pleasures they will indulge; for if it be true,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the human mind leans on one side to the narrow, the practical,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the useful, it naturally rises on the other to the infinite, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spiritual, and the beautiful. Physical wants confine it to the earth;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but, as soon as the tie is loosened, it will unbend itself again.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Not only will the number of those who can take an interest in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"productions of the mind be enlarged, but the taste for intellectual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enjoyment will descend, step by step, even to those who, in aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"societies, seem to have neither time nor ability to in indulge in them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When hereditary wealth, the privileges of rank, and the prerogatives of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"birth have ceased to be, and when every man derives his strength from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself alone, it becomes evident that the chief cause of disparity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between the fortunes of men is the mind. Whatever tends to invigorate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to extend, or to adorn the mind, instantly rises to great value. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,utility of knowledge becomes singularly conspicuous even to the eyes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the multitude: those who have no taste for its charms set store upon its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"results, and make some efforts to acquire it. In free and enlightened","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages, there is nothing to separate men from each other or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to retain them in their peculiar sphere; they rise or sink with extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rapidity. All classes live in perpetual intercourse from their great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proximity to each other. They communicate and intermingle every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,day--they imitate and envy one other: this suggests to the people many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas, notions, and desires which it would never have entertained if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distinctions of rank had been fixed and society at rest. In such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations the servant never considers himself as an entire stranger to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the pleasures and toils of his master, nor the poor man to those of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rich; the rural population assimilates itself to that of the towns, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the provinces to the capital. No one easily allows himself to be reduced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the mere material cares of life; and the humblest artisan casts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at times an eager and a furtive glance into the higher regions of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellect. People do not read with the same notions or in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner as they do in an aristocratic community; but the circle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"readers is unceasingly expanded, till it includes all the citizens.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As soon as the multitude begins to take an interest in the labors of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind, it finds out that to excel in some of them is a powerful method of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquiring fame, power, or wealth. The restless ambition which equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,begets instantly takes this direction as it does all others. The number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those who cultivate science, letters, and the arts, becomes immense.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The intellectual world starts into prodigious activity: everyone,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"endeavors to open for himself a path there, and to draw the eyes of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public after him. Something analogous occurs to what happens in society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the United States, politically considered. What is done is often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imperfect, but the attempts are innumerable; and, although the results","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of individual effort are commonly very small, the total amount is always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very large.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is therefore not true to assert that men living in democratic ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deficiencies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter X: Why The Americans Are More Addicted To Practical Than To,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Theoretical Science,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If a democratic state of society and democratic institutions do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stop the career of the human mind, they incontestably guide it in one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"direction in preference to another. Their effects, thus circumscribed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are still exceedingly great; and I trust I may be pardoned if I pause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for a moment to survey them. We had occasion, in speaking of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophical method of the American people, to make several remarks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which must here be turned to account.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Equality begets in man the desire of judging of everything for himself:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it gives him, in all things, a taste for the tangible and the real,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a contempt for tradition and for forms. These general tendencies are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principally discernible in the peculiar subject of this chapter. Those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who cultivate the sciences amongst a democratic people are always afraid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of losing their way in visionary speculation. They mistrust systems;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they adhere closely to facts and the study of facts with their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"senses. As they do not easily defer to the mere name of any fellow-man,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are never inclined to rest upon any man's authority; but, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, they are unremitting in their efforts to point out the weaker","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,points of their neighbors' opinions. Scientific precedents have very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little weight with them; they are never long detained by the subtilty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the schools, nor ready to accept big words for sterling coin; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"penetrate, as far as they can, into the principal parts of the subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which engages them, and they expound them in the vernacular tongue.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Scientific pursuits then follow a freer and a safer course, but a less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lofty one.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The mind may, as it appears to me, divide science into three parts. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"first comprises the most theoretical principles, and those more abstract","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions whose application is either unknown or very remote. The second,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is composed of those general truths which still belong to pure theory,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but lead, nevertheless, by a straight and short road to practical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,results. Methods of application and means of execution make up the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,third. Each of these different portions of science may be separately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cultivated, although reason and experience show that none of them can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prosper long, if it be absolutely cut off from the two others.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America the purely practical part of science is admirably understood,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and careful attention is paid to the theoretical portion which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,immediately requisite to application. On this head the Americans always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"display a clear, free, original, and inventive power of mind. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hardly anyone in the United States devotes himself to the essentially,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,theoretical and abstract portion of human knowledge. In this respect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Americans carry to excess a tendency which is, I think, discernible,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"though in a less degree, amongst all democratic nations.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nothing is more necessary to the culture of the higher sciences, or of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the more elevated departments of science, than meditation; and nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is less suited to meditation than the structure of democratic society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We do not find there, as amongst an aristocratic people, one class which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,clings to a state of repose because it is well off; and another which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does not venture to stir because it despairs of improving its condition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Everyone is actively in motion: some in quest of power, others of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gain. In the midst of this universal tumult--this incessant conflict of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,jarring interests--this continual stride of men after fortune--where is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that calm to be found which is necessary for the deeper combinations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the intellect? How can the mind dwell upon any single point, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everything whirls around it, and man himself is swept and beaten onwards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the heady current which rolls all things in its course? But the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permanent agitation which subsists in the bosom of a peaceable and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"established democracy, must be distinguished from the tumultuous and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolutionary movements which almost always attend the birth and growth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democratic society. When a violent revolution occurs amongst a highly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"civilized people, it cannot fail to give a sudden impulse to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings and their opinions. This is more particularly true of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic revolutions, which stir up all the classes of which a people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is composed, and beget, at the same time, inordinate ambition in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,breast of every member of the community. The French made most surprising,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advances in the exact sciences at the very time at which they were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,finishing the destruction of the remains of their former feudal society;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"yet this sudden fecundity is not to be attributed to democracy, but to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the unexampled revolution which attended its growth. What happened at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that period was a special incident, and it would be unwise to regard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it as the test of a general principle. Great revolutions are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more common amongst democratic nations than amongst others: I am even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inclined to believe that they are less so. But there prevails amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those populations a small distressing motion--a sort of incessant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"jostling of men--which annoys and disturbs the mind, without exciting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or elevating it. Men who live in democratic communities not only seldom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indulge in meditation, but they naturally entertain very little esteem","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for it. A democratic state of society and democratic institutions plunge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the greater part of men in constant active life; and the habits of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind which are suited to an active life, are not always suited to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemplative one. The man of action is frequently obliged to content,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself with the best he can get, because he would never accomplish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his purpose if he chose to carry every detail to perfection. He has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perpetually occasion to rely on ideas which he has not had leisure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to search to the bottom; for he is much more frequently aided by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opportunity of an idea than by its strict accuracy; and, in the long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"run, he risks less in making use of some false principles, than in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spending his time in establishing all his principles on the basis of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,truth. The world is not led by long or learned demonstrations; a rapid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"glance at particular incidents, the daily study of the fleeting passions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the multitude, the accidents of the time, and the art of turning them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to account, decide all its affairs.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the ages in which active life is the condition of almost everyone,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men are therefore generally led to attach an excessive value to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rapid bursts and superficial conceptions of the intellect; and, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other hand, to depreciate below their true standard its slower and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deeper labors. This opinion of the public influences the judgment of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men who cultivate the sciences; they are persuaded that they may succeed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in those pursuits without meditation, or deterred from such pursuits as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demand it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There are several methods of studying the sciences. Amongst a multitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of men you will find a selfish, mercantile, and trading taste for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the discoveries of the mind, which must not be confounded with that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disinterested passion which is kindled in the heart of the few. A desire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to utilize knowledge is one thing; the pure desire to know is another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I do not doubt that in a few minds and far between, an ardent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inexhaustible love of truth springs up, self-supported, and living in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ceaseless fruition without ever attaining the satisfaction which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seeks. This ardent love it is--this proud, disinterested love of what is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"true--which raises men to the abstract sources of truth, to draw their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mother-knowledge thence. If Pascal had had nothing in view but some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"large gain, or even if he had been stimulated by the love of fame alone,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I cannot conceive that he would ever have been able to rally all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers of his mind, as he did, for the better discovery of the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hidden things of the Creator. When I see him, as it were, tear his soul","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the midst of all the cares of life to devote it wholly to these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"researches, and, prematurely snapping the links which bind the frame to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"life, die of old age before forty, I stand amazed, and I perceive that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no ordinary cause is at work to produce efforts so extra-ordinary.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The future will prove whether these passions, at once so rare and so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"productive, come into being and into growth as easily in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic as in aristocratic communities. For myself, I confess that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am slow to believe it. In aristocratic society, the class which gives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the tone to opinion, and has the supreme guidance of affairs, being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"permanently and hereditarily placed above the multitude, naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceives a lofty idea of itself and of man. It loves to invent for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him noble pleasures, to carve out splendid objects for his ambition.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Aristocracies often commit very tyrannical and very inhuman actions;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but they rarely entertain grovelling thoughts; and they show a kind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"haughty contempt of little pleasures, even whilst they indulge in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. The effect is greatly to raise the general pitch of society. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic ages vast ideas are commonly entertained of the dignity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the power, and the greatness of man. These opinions exert their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influence on those who cultivate the sciences, as well as on the rest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the community. They facilitate the natural impulse of the mind to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"highest regions of thought, and they naturally prepare it to conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a sublime--nay, almost a divine--love of truth. Men of science at such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,periods are consequently carried away by theory; and it even happens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they frequently conceive an inconsiderate contempt for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"practical part of learning. ""Archimedes,"" says Plutarch, ""was of so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lofty a spirit, that he never condescended to write any treatise on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner of constructing all these engines of offence and defence. And as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he held this science of inventing and putting together engines, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arts generally speaking which tended to any useful end in practice, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be vile, low, and mercenary, he spent his talents and his studious hours","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in writing of those things only whose beauty and subtilty had in them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no admixture of necessity."" Such is the aristocratic aim of science; in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations it cannot be the same.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The greater part of the men who constitute these nations are extremely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,eager in the pursuit of actual and physical gratification. As they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always dissatisfied with the position which they occupy, and are always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"free to leave it, they think of nothing but the means of changing their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortune, or of increasing it. To minds thus predisposed, every new","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"method which leads by a shorter road to wealth, every machine which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spares labor, every instrument which diminishes the cost of production,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every discovery which facilitates pleasures or augments them, seems to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be the grandest effort of the human intellect. It is chiefly from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these motives that a democratic people addicts itself to scientific,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuits--that it understands, and that it respects them. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic ages, science is more particularly called upon to furnish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gratification to the mind; in democracies, to the body. You may be sure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the more a nation is democratic, enlightened, and free, the greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will be the number of these interested promoters of scientific genius,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the more will discoveries immediately applicable to productive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industry confer gain, fame, and even power on their authors. For in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracies the working class takes a part in public affairs; and public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"honors, as well as pecuniary remuneration, may be awarded to those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deserve them. In a community thus organized it may easily be conceived,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the human mind may be led insensibly to the neglect of theory; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that it is urged, on the contrary, with unparalleled vehemence to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applications of science, or at least to that portion of theoretical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,science which is necessary to those who make such applications. In vain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will some innate propensity raise the mind towards the loftier spheres,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the intellect; interest draws it down to the middle zone. There it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may develop all its energy and restless activity, there it may engender","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all its wonders. These very Americans, who have not discovered one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the general laws of mechanics, have introduced into navigation an engine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which changes the aspect of the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Assuredly I do not content that the democratic nations of our time are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,destined to witness the extinction of the transcendent luminaries of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man's intelligence, nor even that no new lights will ever start into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"existence. At the age at which the world has now arrived, and amongst so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"many cultivated nations, perpetually excited by the fever of productive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industry, the bonds which connect the different parts of science","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,together cannot fail to strike the observation; and the taste for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"practical science itself, if it be enlightened, ought to lead men not to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neglect theory. In the midst of such numberless attempted applications,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of so many experiments, repeated every day, it is almost impossible that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general laws should not frequently be brought to light; so that great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discoveries would be frequent, though great inventors be rare. I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"believe, moreover, in the high calling of scientific minds. If the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic principle does not, on the one hand, induce men to cultivate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"science for its own sake, on the other it enormously increases the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of those who do cultivate it. Nor is it credible that, from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst so great a multitude no speculative genius should from time to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time arise, inflamed by the love of truth alone. Such a one, we may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sure, would dive into the deepest mysteries of nature, whatever be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the spirit of his country or his age. He requires no assistance in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,course--enough that he be not checked in it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All that I mean to say is this:--permanent inequality of conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leads men to confine themselves to the arrogant and sterile research,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of abstract truths; whilst the social condition and the institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democracy prepare them to seek the immediate and useful practical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,results of the sciences. This tendency is natural and inevitable: it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"curious to be acquainted with it, and it may be necessary to point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it out. If those who are called upon to guide the nations of our time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clearly discerned from afar off these new tendencies, which will soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be irresistible, they would understand that, possessing education","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and freedom, men living in democratic ages cannot fail to improve the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,industrial part of science; and that henceforward all the efforts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the constituted authorities ought to be directed to support the highest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"branches of learning, and to foster the nobler passion for science","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself. In the present age the human mind must be coerced into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,theoretical studies; it runs of its own accord to practical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applications; and, instead of perpetually referring it to the minute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"examination of secondary effects, it is well to divert it from them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes, in order to raise it up to the contemplation of primary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,causes. Because the civilization of ancient Rome perished in consequence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the invasion of the barbarians, we are perhaps too apt to think that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,civilization cannot perish in any other manner. If the light by which we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are guided is ever extinguished, it will dwindle by degrees, and expire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of itself. By dint of close adherence to mere applications, principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"would be lost sight of; and when the principles were wholly forgotten,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the methods derived from them would be ill-pursued. New methods could,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no longer be invented, and men would continue to apply, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intelligence, and without art, scientific processes no longer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understood.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When Europeans first arrived in China, three hundred years ago,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they found that almost all the arts had reached a certain degree of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perfection there; and they were surprised that a people which had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attained this point should not have gone beyond it. At a later period,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they discovered some traces of the higher branches of science which were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lost. The nation was absorbed in productive industry: the greater part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of its scientific processes had been preserved, but science itself no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,longer existed there. This served to explain the strangely motionless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"state in which they found the minds of this people. The Chinese, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"following the track of their forefathers, had forgotten the reasons by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which the latter had been guided. They still used the formula, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"asking for its meaning: they retained the instrument, but they no longer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possessed the art of altering or renewing it. The Chinese, then, had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lost the power of change; for them to improve was impossible. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were compelled, at all times and in all points, to imitate their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"predecessors, lest they should stray into utter darkness, by deviating","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for an instant from the path already laid down for them. The source of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"human knowledge was all but dry; and though the stream still ran on, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,could neither swell its waters nor alter its channel. Notwithstanding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this, China had subsisted peaceably for centuries. The invaders who had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conquered the country assumed the manners of the inhabitants, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order prevailed there. A sort of physical prosperity was everywhere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discernible: revolutions were rare, and war was, so to speak, unknown.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is then a fallacy to flatter ourselves with the reflection that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,barbarians are still far from us; for if there be some nations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"allow civilization to be torn from their grasp, there are others who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,trample it themselves under their feet.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XI: Of The Spirit In Which The Americans Cultivate The Arts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would be to waste the time of my readers and my own if I strove,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to demonstrate how the general mediocrity of fortunes, the absence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superfluous wealth, the universal desire of comfort, and the constant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"efforts by which everyone attempts to procure it, make the taste for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,useful predominate over the love of the beautiful in the heart of man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democratic nations, amongst which all these things exist, will therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cultivate the arts which serve to render life easy, in preference to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those whose object is to adorn it. They will habitually prefer the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"useful to the beautiful, and they will require that the beautiful should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be useful. But I propose to go further; and after having pointed out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this first feature, to sketch several others.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It commonly happens that in the ages of privilege the practice of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all the arts becomes a privilege; and that every profession is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a separate walk, upon which it is not allowable for everyone to enter.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Even when productive industry is free, the fixed character which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belongs to aristocratic nations gradually segregates all the persons who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"practise the same art, till they form a distinct class, always composed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the same families, whose members are all known to each other, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst whom a public opinion of their own and a species of corporate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pride soon spring up. In a class or guild of this kind, each artisan has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not only his fortune to make, but his reputation to preserve. He is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exclusively swayed by his own interest, or even by that of his customer,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but by that of the body to which he belongs; and the interest of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"body is, that each artisan should produce the best possible workmanship.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In aristocratic ages, the object of the arts is therefore to manufacture","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as well as possible--not with the greatest despatch, or at the lowest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rate.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When, on the contrary, every profession is open to all--when a multitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of persons are constantly embracing and abandoning it--and when its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"several members are strangers to each other, indifferent, and from their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"numbers hardly seen amongst themselves; the social tie is destroyed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and each workman, standing alone, endeavors simply to gain the greatest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possible quantity of money at the least possible cost. The will of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,customer is then his only limit. But at the same time a corresponding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolution takes place in the customer also. In countries in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,riches as well as power are concentrated and retained in the hands of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the few, the use of the greater part of this world's goods belongs to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"small number of individuals, who are always the same. Necessity, public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinion, or moderate desires exclude all others from the enjoyment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of them. As this aristocratic class remains fixed at the pinnacle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"greatness on which it stands, without diminution or increase, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always acted upon by the same wants and affected by them in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner. The men of whom it is composed naturally derive from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,superior and hereditary position a taste for what is extremely well made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and lasting. This affects the general way of thinking of the nation in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"relation to the arts. It often occurs, among such a people, that even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the peasant will rather go without the object he covets, than procure it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in a state of imperfection. In aristocracies, then, the handicraftsmen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,work for only a limited number of very fastidious customers: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,profit they hope to make depends principally on the perfection of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,workmanship.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Such is no longer the case when, all privileges being abolished, ranks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are intermingled, and men are forever rising or sinking upon the ladder","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of society. Amongst a democratic people a number of citizens always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exist whose patrimony is divided and decreasing. They have contracted,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"under more prosperous circumstances, certain wants, which remain after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the means of satisfying such wants are gone; and they are anxiously,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,looking out for some surreptitious method of providing for them. On the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other hand, there are always in democracies a large number of men whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortune is upon the increase, but whose desires grow much faster than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their fortunes: and who gloat upon the gifts of wealth in anticipation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,long before they have means to command them. Such men eager to find some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"short cut to these gratifications, already almost within their reach.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"From the combination of these causes the result is, that in democracies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there are always a multitude of individuals whose wants are above their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"means, and who are very willing to take up with imperfect satisfaction","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rather than abandon the object of their desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The artisan readily understands these passions, for he himself partakes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in them: in an aristocracy he would seek to sell his workmanship at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,high price to the few; he now conceives that the more expeditious way of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,getting rich is to sell them at a low price to all. But there are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,two ways of lowering the price of commodities. The first is to discover,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"some better, shorter, and more ingenious method of producing them: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"second is to manufacture a larger quantity of goods, nearly similar,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but of less value. Amongst a democratic population, all the intellectual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,faculties of the workman are directed to these two objects: he strives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to invent methods which may enable him not only to work better, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"quicker and cheaper; or, if he cannot succeed in that, to diminish the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intrinsic qualities of the thing he makes, without rendering it wholly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unfit for the use for which it is intended. When none but the wealthy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had watches, they were almost all very good ones: few are now made which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are worth much, but everybody has one in his pocket. Thus the democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle not only tends to direct the human mind to the useful arts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it induces the artisan to produce with greater rapidity a quantity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of imperfect commodities, and the consumer to content himself with these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,commodities.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Not that in democracies the arts are incapable of producing very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commendable works, if such be required. This may occasionally be the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"case, if customers appear who are ready to pay for time and trouble.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In this rivalry of every kind of industry--in the midst of this immense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"competition and these countless experiments, some excellent workmen are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,formed who reach the utmost limits of their craft. But they have rarely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an opportunity of displaying what they can do; they are scrupulously,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sparing of their powers; they remain in a state of accomplished,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mediocrity, which condemns itself, and, though it be very well able","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to shoot beyond the mark before it, aims only at what it hits. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracies, on the contrary, workmen always do all they can; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when they stop, it is because they have reached the limit of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attainments.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When I arrive in a country where I find some of the finest productions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the arts, I learn from this fact nothing of the social condition or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the political constitution of the country. But if I perceive that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the productions of the arts are generally of an inferior quality, very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abundant and very cheap, I am convinced that, amongst the people where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this occurs, privilege is on the decline, and that ranks are beginning","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to intermingle, and will soon be confounded together.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The handicraftsmen of democratic ages endeavor not only to bring their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"useful productions within the reach of the whole community, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strive to give to all their commodities attractive qualities which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do not in reality possess. In the confusion of all ranks everyone hopes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to appear what he is not, and makes great exertions to succeed in this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object. This sentiment indeed, which is but too natural to the heart of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man, does not originate in the democratic principle; but that principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,applies it to material objects. To mimic virtue is of every age; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hypocrisy of luxury belongs more particularly to the ages of democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,To satisfy these new cravings of human vanity the arts have recourse to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every species of imposture: and these devices sometimes go so far as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,defeat their own purpose. Imitation diamonds are now made which may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,easily mistaken for real ones; as soon as the art of fabricating false,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,diamonds shall have reached so high a degree of perfection that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot be distinguished from real ones, it is probable that both one and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other will be abandoned, and become mere pebbles again.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This leads me to speak of those arts which are called the fine arts, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,way of distinction. I do not believe that it is a necessary effect of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic social condition and of democratic institutions to diminish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the number of men who cultivate the fine arts; but these causes exert,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a very powerful influence on the manner in which these arts are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cultivated. Many of those who had already contracted a taste for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fine arts are impoverished: on the other hand, many of those who are not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"yet rich begin to conceive that taste, at least by imitation; and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of consumers increases, but opulent and fastidious consumers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become more scarce. Something analogous to what I have already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pointed out in the useful arts then takes place in the fine arts;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the productions of artists are more numerous, but the merit of each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"production is diminished. No longer able to soar to what is great, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cultivate what is pretty and elegant; and appearance is more attended,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to than reality. In aristocracies a few great pictures are produced;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic countries, a vast number of insignificant ones. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"former, statues are raised of bronze; in the latter, they are modelled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in plaster.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When I arrived for the first time at New York, by that part of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Atlantic Ocean which is called the Narrows, I was surprised to perceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"along the shore, at some distance from the city, a considerable number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of little palaces of white marble, several of which were built after the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,models of ancient architecture. When I went the next day to inspect more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"closely the building which had particularly attracted my notice, I found","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that its walls were of whitewashed brick, and its columns of painted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wood. All the edifices which I had admired the night before were of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same kind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The social condition and the institutions of democracy impart, moreover,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain peculiar tendencies to all the imitative arts, which it is easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to point out. They frequently withdraw them from the delineation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,soul to fix them exclusively on that of the body: and they substitute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the representation of motion and sensation for that of sentiment and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thought: in a word, they put the real in the place of the ideal. I doubt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whether Raphael studied the minutest intricacies of the mechanism of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human body as thoroughly as the draughtsmen of our own time. He did not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attach the same importance to rigorous accuracy on this point as they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do, because he aspired to surpass nature. He sought to make of man","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something which should be superior to man, and to embellish beauty's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"self. David and his scholars were, on the contrary, as good anatomists","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as they were good painters. They wonderfully depicted the models which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they had before their eyes, but they rarely imagined anything beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them: they followed nature with fidelity: whilst Raphael sought for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,something better than nature. They have left us an exact portraiture,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of man; but he discloses in his works a glimpse of the Divinity. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remark as to the manner of treating a subject is no less applicable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the choice of it. The painters of the Middle Ages generally sought far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"above themselves, and away from their own time, for mighty subjects,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which left to their imagination an unbounded range. Our painters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently employ their talents in the exact imitation of the details,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of private life, which they have always before their eyes; and they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forever copying trivial objects, the originals of which are only too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,abundant in nature.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"Chapter XII: Why The Americans Raise Some Monuments So Insignificant,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,And Others So Important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have just observed, that in democratic ages monuments of the arts tend","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to become more numerous and less important. I now hasten to point out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the exception to this rule. In a democratic community individuals are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very powerless; but the State which represents them all, and contains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them all in its grasp, is very powerful. Nowhere do citizens appear so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insignificant as in a democratic nation; nowhere does the nation itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appear greater, or does the mind more easily take in a wide general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,survey of it. In democratic communities the imagination is compressed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,when men consider themselves; it expands indefinitely when they think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the State. Hence it is that the same men who live on a small scale in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"narrow dwellings, frequently aspire to gigantic splendor in the erection","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their public monuments.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans traced out the circuit of an immense city on the site,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they intended to make their capital, but which, up to the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, is hardly more densely peopled than Pontoise, though, according","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to them, it will one day contain a million of inhabitants. They have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"already rooted up trees for ten miles round, lest they should interfere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with the future citizens of this imaginary metropolis. They have erected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a magnificent palace for Congress in the centre of the city, and have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,given it the pompous name of the Capitol. The several States of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Union are every day planning and erecting for themselves prodigious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertakings, which would astonish the engineers of the great European","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations. Thus democracy not only leads men to a vast number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inconsiderable productions; it also leads them to raise some monuments,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on the largest scale: but between these two extremes there is a blank.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A few scattered remains of enormous buildings can therefore teach us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing of the social condition and the institutions of the people by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whom they were raised. I may add, though the remark leads me to step","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"out of my subject, that they do not make us better acquainted with its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"greatness, its civilization, and its real prosperity. Whensoever a power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of any kind shall be able to make a whole people co-operate in a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertaking, that power, with a little knowledge and a great deal of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, will succeed in obtaining something enormous from the co-operation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of efforts so multiplied. But this does not lead to the conclusion that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people was very happy, very enlightened, or even very strong.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Spaniards found the City of Mexico full of magnificent temples,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and vast palaces; but that did not prevent Cortes from conquering the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Mexican Empire with 600 foot soldiers and sixteen horses. If the Romans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had been better acquainted with the laws of hydraulics, they would not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have constructed all the aqueducts which surround the ruins of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cities--they would have made a better use of their power and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealth. If they had invented the steam-engine, perhaps they would not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have extended to the extremities of their empire those long artificial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,roads which are called Roman roads. These things are at once the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,splendid memorials of their ignorance and of their greatness. A people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which should leave no other vestige of its track than a few leaden pipes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the earth and a few iron rods upon its surface, might have been more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the master of nature than the Romans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIII: Literary Characteristics Of Democratic Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When a traveller goes into a bookseller's shop in the United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and examines the American books upon the shelves, the number of works","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appears extremely great; whilst that of known authors appears, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, to be extremely small. He will first meet with a number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of elementary treatises, destined to teach the rudiments of human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,knowledge. Most of these books are written in Europe; the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reprint them, adapting them to their own country. Next comes an enormous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"quantity of religious works, Bibles, sermons, edifying anecdotes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"controversial divinity, and reports of charitable societies; lastly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appears the long catalogue of political pamphlets. In America, parties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not write books to combat each others' opinions, but pamphlets which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are circulated for a day with incredible rapidity, and then expire. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the midst of all these obscure productions of the human brain are to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"found the more remarkable works of that small number of authors, whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"names are, or ought to be, known to Europeans.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Although America is perhaps in our days the civilized country in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which literature is least attended to, a large number of persons are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nevertheless to be found there who take an interest in the productions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the mind, and who make them, if not the study of their lives, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,least the charm of their leisure hours. But England supplies these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,readers with the larger portion of the books which they require. Almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all important English books are republished in the United States. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literary genius of Great Britain still darts its rays into the recesses,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the forests of the New World. There is hardly a pioneer's hut which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does not contain a few odd volumes of Shakespeare. I remember that I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,read the feudal play of Henry V for the first time in a loghouse.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Not only do the Americans constantly draw upon the treasures of English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literature, but it may be said with truth that they find the literature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of England growing on their own soil. The larger part of that small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of men in the United States who are engaged in the composition of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literary works are English in substance, and still more so in form.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus they transport into the midst of democracy the ideas and literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fashions which are current amongst the aristocratic nation they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taken for their model. They paint with colors borrowed from foreign,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manners; and as they hardly ever represent the country they were born,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in as it really is, they are seldom popular there. The citizens of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,United States are themselves so convinced that it is not for them that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"books are published, that before they can make up their minds upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"merit of one of their authors, they generally wait till his fame has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been ratified in England, just as in pictures the author of an original","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is held to be entitled to judge of the merit of a copy. The inhabitants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the United States have then at present, properly speaking, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literature. The only authors whom I acknowledge as American are the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"journalists. They indeed are not great writers, but they speak the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"language of their countrymen, and make themselves heard by them. Other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,authors are aliens; they are to the Americans what the imitators of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Greeks and Romans were to us at the revival of learning--an object of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"curiosity, not of general sympathy. They amuse the mind, but they do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,act upon the manners of the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have already said that this state of things is very far from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"originating in democracy alone, and that the causes of it must be sought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for in several peculiar circumstances independent of the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle. If the Americans, retaining the same laws and social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition, had had a different origin, and had been transported","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into another country, I do not question that they would have had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a literature. Even as they now are, I am convinced that they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ultimately have one; but its character will be different from that which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"marks the American literary productions of our time, and that character","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be peculiarly its own. Nor is it impossible to trace this character,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,beforehand.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I suppose an aristocratic people amongst whom letters are cultivated;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the labors of the mind, as well as the affairs of state, are conducted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by a ruling class in society. The literary as well as the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"career is almost entirely confined to this class, or to those nearest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to it in rank. These premises suffice to give me a key to all the rest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When a small number of the same men are engaged at the same time upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same objects, they easily concert with one another, and agree upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain leading rules which are to govern them each and all. If the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object which attracts the attention of these men is literature, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productions of the mind will soon be subjected by them to precise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"canons, from which it will no longer be allowable to depart. If these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men occupy a hereditary position in the country, they will be naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inclined, not only to adopt a certain number of fixed rules for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, but to follow those which their forefathers laid down for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own guidance; their code will be at once strict and traditional.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As they are not necessarily engrossed by the cares of daily life--as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they have never been so, any more than their fathers were before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them--they have learned to take an interest, for several generations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"back, in the labors of the mind. They have learned to understand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literature as an art, to love it in the end for its own sake, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feel a scholar-like satisfaction in seeing men conform to its rules. Nor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is this all: the men of whom I speak began and will end their lives in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,easy or in affluent circumstances; hence they have naturally conceived,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a taste for choice gratifications, and a love of refined and delicate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasures. Nay more, a kind of indolence of mind and heart, which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently contract in the midst of this long and peaceful enjoyment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of so much welfare, leads them to put aside, even from their pleasures,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whatever might be too startling or too acute. They had rather be amused,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than intensely excited; they wish to be interested, but not to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,carried away.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Now let us fancy a great number of literary performances executed by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, or for the men, whom I have just described, and we shall readily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceive a style of literature in which everything will be regular and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prearranged. The slightest work will be carefully touched in its least,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,details; art and labor will be conspicuous in everything; each kind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"writing will have rules of its own, from which it will not be allowed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"swerve, and which distinguish it from all others. Style will be thought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of almost as much importance as thought; and the form will be no less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"considered than the matter: the diction will be polished, measured,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and uniform. The tone of the mind will be always dignified, seldom very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,animated; and writers will care more to perfect what they produce than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to multiply their productions. It will sometimes happen that the members,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the literary class, always living amongst themselves and writing for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves alone, will lose sight of the rest of the world, which will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infect them with a false and labored style; they will lay down minute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literary rules for their exclusive use, which will insensibly lead them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to deviate from common-sense, and finally to transgress the bounds of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nature. By dint of striving after a mode of parlance different from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the vulgar, they will arrive at a sort of aristocratic jargon, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hardly less remote from pure language than is the coarse dialect of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people. Such are the natural perils of literature amongst aristocracies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Every aristocracy which keeps itself entirely aloof from the people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,becomes impotent--a fact which is as true in literature as it is in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,politics. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: All this is especially true of the aristocratic countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which have been long and peacefully subject to a monarchical government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When liberty prevails in an aristocracy, the higher ranks are constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obliged to make use of the lower classes; and when they use, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,approach them. This frequently introduces something of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirit into an aristocratic community. There springs up, moreover, in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privileged body, governing with energy and an habitually bold policy, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taste for stir and excitement which must infallibly affect all literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,performances.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Let us now turn the picture and consider the other side of it; let us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transport ourselves into the midst of a democracy, not unprepared by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ancient traditions and present culture to partake in the pleasures of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the mind. Ranks are there intermingled and confounded; knowledge and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power are both infinitely subdivided, and, if I may use the expression,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"scattered on every side. Here then is a motley multitude, whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellectual wants are to be supplied. These new votaries of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures of the mind have not all received the same education; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not possess the same degree of culture as their fathers, nor any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resemblance to them--nay, they perpetually differ from themselves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for they live in a state of incessant change of place, feelings,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and fortunes. The mind of each member of the community is therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unattached to that of his fellow-citizens by tradition or by common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits; and they have never had the power, the inclination, nor the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time to concert together. It is, however, from the bosom of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,heterogeneous and agitated mass that authors spring; and from the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,source their profits and their fame are distributed. I can without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difficulty understand that, under these circumstances, I must expect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to meet in the literature of such a people with but few of those strict,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conventional rules which are admitted by readers and by writers in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic ages. If it should happen that the men of some one period,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were agreed upon any such rules, that would prove nothing for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,following period; for amongst democratic nations each new generation is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a new people. Amongst such nations, then, literature will not easily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be subjected to strict rules, and it is impossible that any such rules","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should ever be permanent.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In democracies it is by no means the case that all the men who cultivate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literature have received a literary education; and most of those who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have some tinge of belles-lettres are either engaged in politics, or in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a profession which only allows them to taste occasionally and by stealth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the pleasures of the mind. These pleasures, therefore, do not constitute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the principal charm of their lives; but they are considered as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,transient and necessary recreation amidst the serious labors of life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Such man can never acquire a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the art,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of literature to appreciate its more delicate beauties; and the minor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shades of expression must escape them. As the time they can devote to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"letters is very short, they seek to make the best use of the whole of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. They prefer books which may be easily procured, quickly read, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which require no learned researches to be understood. They ask for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beauties, self-proffered and easily enjoyed; above all, they must have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"what is unexpected and new. Accustomed to the struggle, the crosses, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the monotony of practical life, they require rapid emotions, startling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passages--truths or errors brilliant enough to rouse them up, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"plunge them at once, as if by violence, into the midst of a subject.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Why should I say more? or who does not understand what is about to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"follow, before I have expressed it? Taken as a whole, literature","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic ages can never present, as it does in the periods of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy, an aspect of order, regularity, science, and art; its form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will, on the contrary, ordinarily be slighted, sometimes despised. Style","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will frequently be fantastic, incorrect, overburdened, and loose--almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always vehement and bold. Authors will aim at rapidity of execution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more than at perfection of detail. Small productions will be more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common than bulky books; there will be more wit than erudition, more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imagination than profundity; and literary performances will bear marks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an untutored and rude vigor of thought--frequently of great variety,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and singular fecundity. The object of authors will be to astonish rather,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Here and there, indeed, writers will doubtless occur who will choose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a different track, and who will, if they are gifted with superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abilities, succeed in finding readers, in spite of their defects or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their better qualities; but these exceptions will be rare, and even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the authors who shall so depart from the received practice in the main,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subject of their works, will always relapse into it in some lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,details.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have just depicted two extreme conditions: the transition by which a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation passes from the former to the latter is not sudden but gradual,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and marked with shades of very various intensity. In the passage which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conducts a lettered people from the one to the other, there is almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always a moment at which the literary genius of democratic nations has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its confluence with that of aristocracies, and both seek to establish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their joint sway over the human mind. Such epochs are transient, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very brilliant: they are fertile without exuberance, and animated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without confusion. The French literature of the eighteenth century may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,serve as an example.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I should say more than I mean if I were to assert that the literature of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a nation is always subordinate to its social condition and its political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitution. I am aware that, independently of these causes, there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are several others which confer certain characteristics on literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productions; but these appear to me to be the chief. The relations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exist between the social and political condition of a people and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,genius of its authors are always very numerous: whoever knows the one is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never completely ignorant of the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democracy not only infuses a taste for letters among the trading,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes, but introduces a trading spirit into literature. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracies, readers are fastidious and few in number; in democracies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are far more numerous and far less difficult to please. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence is, that among aristocratic nations, no one can hope to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"succeed without immense exertions, and that these exertions may bestow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a great deal of fame, but can never earn much money; whilst among","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations, a writer may flatter himself that he will obtain at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a cheap rate a meagre reputation and a large fortune. For this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,purpose he need not be admired; it is enough that he is liked. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ever-increasing crowd of readers, and their continual craving for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something new, insure the sale of books which nobody much esteems.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In democratic periods the public frequently treat authors as kings do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their courtiers; they enrich, and they despise them. What more is needed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the venal souls which are born in courts, or which are worthy to live","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there? Democratic literature is always infested with a tribe of writers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who look upon letters as a mere trade: and for some few great authors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who adorn it you may reckon thousands of idea-mongers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XV: The Study Of Greek And Latin Literature Peculiarly Useful In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic Communities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What was called the People in the most democratic republics of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"antiquity, was very unlike what we designate by that term. In Athens,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the citizens took part in public affairs; but there were only 20,000","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizens to more than 350,000 inhabitants. All the rest were slaves, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discharged the greater part of those duties which belong at the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day to the lower or even to the middle classes. Athens, then, with her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"universal suffrage, was after all merely an aristocratic republic in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which all the nobles had an equal right to the government. The struggle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between the patricians and plebeians of Rome must be considered in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same light: it was simply an intestine feud between the elder and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"younger branches of the same family. All the citizens belonged, in fact,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the aristocracy, and partook of its character.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is moreover to be remarked, that amongst the ancients books were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always scarce and dear; and that very great difficulties impeded their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,publication and circulation. These circumstances concentrated literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tastes and habits amongst a small number of men, who formed a small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literary aristocracy out of the choicer spirits of the great political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracy. Accordingly nothing goes to prove that literature was ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,treated as a trade amongst the Greeks and Romans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These peoples, which not only constituted aristocracies, but very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"polished and free nations, of course imparted to their literary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productions the defects and the merits which characterize the literature,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of aristocratic ages. And indeed a very superficial survey of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literary remains of the ancients will suffice to convince us, that if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those writers were sometimes deficient in variety, or fertility in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subjects, or in boldness, vivacity, or power of generalization in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their thoughts, they always displayed exquisite care and skill in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,details. Nothing in their works seems to be done hastily or at random:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every line is written for the eye of the connoisseur, and is shaped","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,after some conception of ideal beauty. No literature places those fine,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"qualities, in which the writers of democracies are naturally deficient,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in bolder relief than that of the ancients; no literature, therefore,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ought to be more studied in democratic ages. This study is better suited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than any other to combat the literary defects inherent in those ages; as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for their more praiseworthy literary qualities, they will spring up of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own accord, without its being necessary to learn to acquire them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is important that this point should be clearly understood. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"particular study may be useful to the literature of a people, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,being appropriate to its social and political wants. If men were to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persist in teaching nothing but the literature of the dead languages in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a community where everyone is habitually led to make vehement exertions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to augment or to maintain his fortune, the result would be a very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"polished, but a very dangerous, race of citizens. For as their social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and political condition would give them every day a sense of wants which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their education would never teach them to supply, they would perturb the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"State, in the name of the Greeks and Romans, instead of enriching it by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their productive industry.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is evident that in democratic communities the interest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individuals, as well as the security of the commonwealth, demands that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the education of the greater number should be scientific, commercial,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and industrial, rather than literary. Greek and Latin should not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taught in all schools; but it is important that those who by their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural disposition or their fortune are destined to cultivate letters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or prepared to relish them, should find schools where a complete","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knowledge of ancient literature may be acquired, and where the true","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,scholar may be formed. A few excellent universities would do more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,towards the attainment of this object than a vast number of bad grammar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"schools, where superfluous matters, badly learned, stand in the way of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sound instruction in necessary studies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"All who aspire to literary excellence in democratic nations, ought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently to refresh themselves at the springs of ancient literature:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there is no more wholesome course for the mind. Not that I hold the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literary productions of the ancients to be irreproachable; but I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"think that they have some especial merits, admirably calculated to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,counterbalance our peculiar defects. They are a prop on the side on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which we are in most danger of falling.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVI: The Effect Of Democracy On Language,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If the reader has rightly understood what I have already said on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the subject of literature in general, he will have no difficulty in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,comprehending that species of influence which a democratic social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition and democratic institutions may exercise over language itself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which is the chief instrument of thought.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American authors may truly be said to live more in England than in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own country; since they constantly study the English writers, and take","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them every day for their models. But such is not the case with the bulk,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the population, which is more immediately subjected to the peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"causes acting upon the United States. It is not then to the written, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the spoken language that attention must be paid, if we would detect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the modifications which the idiom of an aristocratic people may undergo,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,when it becomes the language of a democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Englishmen of education, and more competent judges than I can be myself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the nicer shades of expression, have frequently assured me that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the language of the educated classes in the United States is notably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different from that of the educated classes in Great Britain. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,complain not only that the Americans have brought into use a number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,new words--the difference and the distance between the two countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,might suffice to explain that much--but that these new words are more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"especially taken from the jargon of parties, the mechanical arts, or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"language of trade. They assert, in addition to this, that old English","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"words are often used by the Americans in new acceptations; and lastly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the inhabitants of the United States frequently intermingle their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"phraseology in the strangest manner, and sometimes place words together","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which are always kept apart in the language of the mother-country. These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remarks, which were made to me at various times by persons who appeared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be worthy of credit, led me to reflect upon the subject; and my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reflections brought me, by theoretical reasoning, to the same point at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which my informants had arrived by practical observation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In aristocracies, language must naturally partake of that state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"repose in which everything remains. Few new words are coined, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"few new things are made; and even if new things were made, they would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be designated by known words, whose meaning has been determined by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tradition. If it happens that the human mind bestirs itself at length,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or is roused by light breaking in from without, the novel expressions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are introduced are characterized by a degree of learning,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intelligence, and philosophy, which shows that they do not originate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in a democracy. After the fall of Constantinople had turned the tide of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"science and literature towards the west, the French language was almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immediately invaded by a multitude of new words, which had all Greek","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or Latin roots. An erudite neologism then sprang up in France which was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confined to the educated classes, and which produced no sensible effect,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or at least a very gradual one, upon the people. All the nations of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Europe successively exhibited the same change. Milton alone introduced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more than six hundred words into the English language, almost all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"derived from the Latin, the Greek, or the Hebrew. The constant agitation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which prevails in a democratic community tends unceasingly, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, to change the character of the language, as it does the aspect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of affairs. In the midst of this general stir and competition of minds,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a great number of new ideas are formed, old ideas are lost, or reappear,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or are subdivided into an infinite variety of minor shades. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence is, that many words must fall into desuetude, and others","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must be brought into use.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic nations love change for its own sake; and this is seen in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their language as much as in their politics. Even when they do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"need to change words, they sometimes feel a wish to transform them. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,genius of a democratic people is not only shown by the great number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"words they bring into use, but also by the nature of the ideas these new","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,words represent. Amongst such a people the majority lays down the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in language as well as in everything else; its prevailing spirit is as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manifest in that as in other respects. But the majority is more engaged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in business than in study--in political and commercial interests than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,philosophical speculation or literary pursuits. Most of the words coined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or adopted for its use will therefore bear the mark of these habits;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they will mainly serve to express the wants of business, the passions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"party, or the details of the public administration. In these departments","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the language will constantly spread, whilst on the other hand it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gradually lose ground in metaphysics and theology.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As to the source from which democratic nations are wont to derive their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"new expressions, and the manner in which they go to work to coin them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,both may easily be described. Men living in democratic countries know,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but little of the language which was spoken at Athens and at Rome,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they do not care to dive into the lore of antiquity to find the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,expression they happen to want. If they have sometimes recourse to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"learned etymologies, vanity will induce them to search at the roots of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the dead languages; but erudition does not naturally furnish them with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its resources. The most ignorant, it sometimes happens, will use them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most. The eminently democratic desire to get above their own sphere will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,often lead them to seek to dignify a vulgar profession by a Greek or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Latin name. The lower the calling is, and the more remote from learning,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the more pompous and erudite is its appellation. Thus the French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rope-dancers have transformed themselves into acrobates and funambules.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the absence of knowledge of the dead languages, democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations are apt to borrow words from living tongues; for their mutual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intercourse becomes perpetual, and the inhabitants of different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,countries imitate each other the more readily as they grow more like,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other every day.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But it is principally upon their own languages that democratic nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attempt to perpetrate innovations. From time to time they resume,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forgotten expressions in their vocabulary, which they restore to use; or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they borrow from some particular class of the community a term peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to it, which they introduce with a figurative meaning into the language","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of daily life. Many expressions which originally belonged to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"technical language of a profession or a party, are thus drawn into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general circulation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The most common expedient employed by democratic nations to make an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,innovation in language consists in giving some unwonted meaning to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an expression already in use. This method is very simple, prompt, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"convenient; no learning is required to use it aright, and ignorance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself rather facilitates the practice; but that practice is most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dangerous to the language. When a democratic people doubles the meaning,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a word in this way, they sometimes render the signification which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,retains as ambiguous as that which it acquires. An author begins by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"slight deflection of a known expression from its primitive meaning, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he adapts it, thus modified, as well as he can to his subject. A second","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,writer twists the sense of the expression in another way; a third takes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possession of it for another purpose; and as there is no common appeal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the sentence of a permanent tribunal which may definitely settle the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"signification of the word, it remains in an ambiguous condition. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequence is that writers hardly ever appear to dwell upon a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thought, but they always seem to point their aim at a knot of ideas,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leaving the reader to judge which of them has been hit. This is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deplorable consequence of democracy. I had rather that the language,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should be made hideous with words imported from the Chinese, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Tartars, or the Hurons, than that the meaning of a word in our own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,language should become indeterminate. Harmony and uniformity are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only secondary beauties in composition; many of these things are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conventional, and, strictly speaking, it is possible to forego them; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without clear phraseology there is no good language.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The principle of equality necessarily introduces several other changes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into language. In aristocratic ages, when each nation tends to stand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aloof from all others and likes to have distinct characteristics of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own, it often happens that several peoples which have a common origin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become nevertheless estranged from each other, so that, without ceasing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to understand the same language, they no longer all speak it in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner. In these ages each nation is divided into a certain number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes, which see but little of each other, and do not intermingle.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Each of these classes contracts, and invariably retains, habits of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind peculiar to itself, and adopts by choice certain words and certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"terms, which afterwards pass from generation to generation, like their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,estates. The same idiom then comprises a language of the poor and a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,language of the rich--a language of the citizen and a language of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nobility--a learned language and a vulgar one. The deeper the divisions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the more impassable the barriers of society become, the more must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this be the case. I would lay a wager, that amongst the castes of India","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there are amazing variations of language, and that there is almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as much difference between the language of the pariah and that of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Brahmin as there is in their dress. When, on the contrary, men, being no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"longer restrained by ranks, meet on terms of constant intercourse--when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"castes are destroyed, and the classes of society are recruited and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intermixed with each other, all the words of a language are mingled.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Those which are unsuitable to the greater number perish; the remainder,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"form a common store, whence everyone chooses pretty nearly at random.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Almost all the different dialects which divided the idioms of European,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations are manifestly declining; there is no patois in the New World,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it is disappearing every day from the old countries.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The influence of this revolution in social conditions is as much felt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in style as it is in phraseology. Not only does everyone use the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"words, but a habit springs up of using them without discrimination. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rules which style had set up are almost abolished: the line ceases to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be drawn between expressions which seem by their very nature vulgar, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other which appear to be refined. Persons springing from different ranks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of society carry the terms and expressions they are accustomed to use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with them, into whatever circumstances they may pass; thus the origin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of words is lost like the origin of individuals, and there is as much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confusion in language as there is in society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am aware that in the classification of words there are rules which do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not belong to one form of society any more than to another, but which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are derived from the nature of things. Some expressions and phrases,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are vulgar, because the ideas they are meant to express are low in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves; others are of a higher character, because the objects they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are intended to designate are naturally elevated. No intermixture of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ranks will ever efface these differences. But the principle of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot fail to root out whatever is merely conventional and arbitrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the forms of thought. Perhaps the necessary classification which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I pointed out in the last sentence will always be less respected by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people than by any other, because amongst such a people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there are no men who are permanently disposed by education, culture, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leisure to study the natural laws of language, and who cause those laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be respected by their own observance of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I shall not quit this topic without touching on a feature of democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"languages, which is perhaps more characteristic of them than any other.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It has already been shown that democratic nations have a taste, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes a passion, for general ideas, and that this arises from their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiar merits and defects. This liking for general ideas is displayed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in democratic languages by the continual use of generic terms or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abstract expressions, and by the manner in which they are employed.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This is the great merit and the great imperfection of these languages.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic nations are passionately addicted to generic terms or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abstract expressions, because these modes of speech enlarge thought,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and assist the operations of the mind by enabling it to include several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,objects in a small compass. A French democratic writer will be apt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to say capacites in the abstract for men of capacity, and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,particularizing the objects to which their capacity is applied: he will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,talk about actualities to designate in one word the things passing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,before his eyes at the instant; and he will comprehend under the term,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eventualities whatever may happen in the universe, dating from the moment","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at which he speaks. Democratic writers are perpetually coining words of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this kind, in which they sublimate into further abstraction the abstract","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"terms of the language. Nay, more, to render their mode of speech more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"succinct, they personify the subject of these abstract terms, and make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it act like a real entity. Thus they would say in French, ""La force des","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"choses veut que les capacites gouvernent.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I cannot better illustrate what I mean than by my own example. I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequently used the word ""equality"" in an absolute sense--nay, I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,personified equality in several places; thus I have said that equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"does such and such things, or refrains from doing others. It may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,affirmed that the writers of the age of Louis XIV would not have used,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these expressions: they would never have thought of using the word,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""equality"" without applying it to some particular object; and they would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rather have renounced the term altogether than have consented to make a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,living personage of it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These abstract terms which abound in democratic languages, and which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"used on every occasion without attaching them to any particular fact,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enlarge and obscure the thoughts they are intended to convey; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"render the mode of speech more succinct, and the idea contained in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it less clear. But with regard to language, democratic nations prefer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obscurity to labor. I know not indeed whether this loose style has not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,some secret charm for those who speak and write amongst these nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As the men who live there are frequently left to the efforts of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual powers of mind, they are almost always a prey to doubt; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as their situation in life is forever changing, they are never held fast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to any of their opinions by the certain tenure of their fortunes. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"living in democratic countries are, then, apt to entertain unsettled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas, and they require loose expressions to convey them. As they never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,know whether the idea they express to-day will be appropriate to the new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position they may occupy to-morrow, they naturally acquire a liking for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,abstract terms. An abstract term is like a box with a false bottom: you,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may put in it what ideas you please, and take them out again without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,being observed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst all nations, generic and abstract terms form the basis of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"language. I do not, therefore, affect to expel these terms from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic languages; I simply remark that men have an especial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tendency, in the ages of democracy, to multiply words of this kind--to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"take them always by themselves in their most abstract acceptation, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to use them on all occasions, even when the nature of the discourse does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not require them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVII: Of Some Of The Sources Of Poetry Amongst Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Various different significations have been given to the word ""poetry.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would weary my readers if I were to lead them into a discussion as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which of these definitions ought to be selected: I prefer telling them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at once that which I have chosen. In my opinion, poetry is the search","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the delineation of the ideal. The poet is he who, by suppressing a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part of what exists, by adding some imaginary touches to the picture,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and by combining certain real circumstances, but which do not in fact","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concurrently happen, completes and extends the work of nature. Thus the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of poetry is not to represent what is true, but to adorn it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to present to the mind some loftier imagery. Verse, regarded as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideal beauty of language, may be eminently poetical; but verse does not,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of itself, constitute poetry.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I now proceed to inquire whether, amongst the actions, the sentiments,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the opinions of democratic nations, there are any which lead to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conception of ideal beauty, and which may for this reason be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"considered as natural sources of poetry. It must in the first place, be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acknowledged that the taste for ideal beauty, and the pleasure derived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the expression of it, are never so intense or so diffused amongst a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic as amongst an aristocratic people. In aristocratic nations it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes happens that the body goes on to act as it were spontaneously,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whilst the higher faculties are bound and burdened by repose. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these nations the people will very often display poetic tastes, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sometimes allow their fancy to range beyond and above what surrounds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them. But in democracies the love of physical gratification, the notion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of bettering one's condition, the excitement of competition, the charm","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of anticipated success, are so many spurs to urge men onwards in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"active professions they have embraced, without allowing them to deviate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for an instant from the track. The main stress of the faculties is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this point. The imagination is not extinct; but its chief function is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"devise what may be useful, and to represent what is real.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The principle of equality not only diverts men from the description of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ideal beauty--it also diminishes the number of objects to be described.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Aristocracy, by maintaining society in a fixed position, is favorable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the solidity and duration of positive religions, as well as to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stability of political institutions. It not only keeps the human mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"within a certain sphere of belief, but it predisposes the mind to adopt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,one faith rather than another. An aristocratic people will always be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prone to place intermediate powers between God and man. In this respect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it may be said that the aristocratic element is favorable to poetry.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the universe is peopled with supernatural creatures, not palpable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the senses but discovered by the mind, the imagination ranges","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freely, and poets, finding a thousand subjects to delineate, also find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a countless audience to take an interest in their productions. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages it sometimes happens, on the contrary, that men are as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much afloat in matters of belief as they are in their laws. Scepticism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then draws the imagination of poets back to earth, and confines them to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the real and visible world. Even when the principle of equality does,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not disturb religious belief, it tends to simplify it, and to divert","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attention from secondary agents, to fix it principally on the Supreme","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Power. Aristocracy naturally leads the human mind to the contemplation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the past, and fixes it there. Democracy, on the contrary, gives men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a sort of instinctive distaste for what is ancient. In this respect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracy is far more favorable to poetry; for things commonly grow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,larger and more obscure as they are more remote; and for this twofold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reason they are better suited to the delineation of the ideal.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"After having deprived poetry of the past, the principle of equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,robs it in part of the present. Amongst aristocratic nations there are a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain number of privileged personages, whose situation is, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without and above the condition of man; to these, power, wealth, fame,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wit, refinement, and distinction in all things appear peculiarly to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belong. The crowd never sees them very closely, or does not watch them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in minute details; and little is needed to make the description of such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men poetical. On the other hand, amongst the same people, you will meet","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with classes so ignorant, low, and enslaved, that they are no less fit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"objects for poetry from the excess of their rudeness and wretchedness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than the former are from their greatness and refinement. Besides, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the different classes of which an aristocratic community is composed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are widely separated, and imperfectly acquainted with each other, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagination may always represent them with some addition to, or some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subtraction from, what they really are. In democratic communities, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men are all insignificant and very much alike, each man instantly sees","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all his fellows when he surveys himself. The poets of democratic ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can never, therefore, take any man in particular as the subject of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"piece; for an object of slender importance, which is distinctly seen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on all sides, will never lend itself to an ideal conception. Thus the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle of equality; in proportion as it has established itself in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world, has dried up most of the old springs of poetry. Let us now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attempt to show what new ones it may disclose.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When scepticism had depopulated heaven, and the progress of equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had reduced each individual to smaller and better known proportions, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"poets, not yet aware of what they could substitute for the great themes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which were departing together with the aristocracy, turned their eyes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to inanimate nature. As they lost sight of gods and heroes, they set","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves to describe streams and mountains. Thence originated in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the last century, that kind of poetry which has been called, by way","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of distinction, the descriptive. Some have thought that this sort of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"delineation, embellished with all the physical and inanimate objects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which cover the earth, was the kind of poetry peculiar to democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ages; but I believe this to be an error, and that it only belongs to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,period of transition.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am persuaded that in the end democracy diverts the imagination from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all that is external to man, and fixes it on man alone. Democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations may amuse themselves for a while with considering the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productions of nature; but they are only excited in reality by a survey,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of themselves. Here, and here alone, the true sources of poetry amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such nations are to be found; and it may be believed that the poets who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shall neglect to draw their inspirations hence, will lose all sway over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the minds which they would enchant, and will be left in the end with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,none but unimpassioned spectators of their transports. I have shown how,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the ideas of progression and of the indefinite perfectibility of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human race belong to democratic ages. Democratic nations care but little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for what has been, but they are haunted by visions of what will be; in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this direction their unbounded imagination grows and dilates beyond all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"measure. Here then is the wildest range open to the genius of poets,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which allows them to remove their performances to a sufficient distance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the eye. Democracy shuts the past against the poet, but opens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the future before him. As all the citizens who compose a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community are nearly equal and alike, the poet cannot dwell upon any one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of them; but the nation itself invites the exercise of his powers. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general similitude of individuals, which renders any one of them taken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"separately an improper subject of poetry, allows poets to include them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all in the same imagery, and to take a general survey of the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself. Democractic nations have a clearer perception than any others of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own aspect; and an aspect so imposing is admirably fitted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,delineation of the ideal.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I readily admit that the Americans have no poets; I cannot allow that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they have no poetic ideas. In Europe people talk a great deal of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wilds of America, but the Americans themselves never think about them:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are insensible to the wonders of inanimate nature, and they may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,said not to perceive the mighty forests which surround them till they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fall beneath the hatchet. Their eyes are fixed upon another sight: the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"American people views its own march across these wilds--drying swamps,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"turning the course of rivers, peopling solitudes, and subduing nature.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This magnificent image of themselves does not meet the gaze of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans at intervals only; it may be said to haunt every one of them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in his least as well as in his most important actions, and to be always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"flitting before his mind. Nothing conceivable is so petty, so insipid,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so crowded with paltry interests, in one word so anti-poetic, as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,life of a man in the United States. But amongst the thoughts which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"suggests there is always one which is full of poetry, and that is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hidden nerve which gives vigor to the frame.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In aristocratic ages each people, as well as each individual, is prone","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to stand separate and aloof from all others. In democratic ages, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extreme fluctuations of men and the impatience of their desires keep,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them perpetually on the move; so that the inhabitants of different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"countries intermingle, see, listen to, and borrow from each other's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stores. It is not only then the members of the same community who grow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more alike; communities are themselves assimilated to one another,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the whole assemblage presents to the eye of the spectator one vast,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy, each citizen of which is a people. This displays the aspect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of mankind for the first time in the broadest light. All that belongs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the existence of the human race taken as a whole, to its vicissitudes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to its future, becomes an abundant mine of poetry. The poets who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lived in aristocratic ages have been eminently successful in their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,delineations of certain incidents in the life of a people or a man;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but none of them ever ventured to include within his performances the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,destinies of mankind--a task which poets writing in democratic ages may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attempt. At that same time at which every man, raising his eyes above","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his country, begins at length to discern mankind at large, the Divinity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is more and more manifest to the human mind in full and entire majesty.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If in democratic ages faith in positive religions be often shaken, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the belief in intermediate agents, by whatever name they are called, be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,overcast; on the other hand men are disposed to conceive a far broader,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"idea of Providence itself, and its interference in human affairs assumes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a new and more imposing appearance to their eyes. Looking at the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"race as one great whole, they easily conceive that its destinies are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,regulated by the same design; and in the actions of every individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are led to acknowledge a trace of that universal and eternal plan,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on which God rules our race. This consideration may be taken as another,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prolific source of poetry which is opened in democratic ages. Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"poets will always appear trivial and frigid if they seek to invest gods,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"demons, or angels, with corporeal forms, and if they attempt to draw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them down from heaven to dispute the supremacy of earth. But if they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strive to connect the great events they commemorate with the general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"providential designs which govern the universe, and, without showing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"finger of the Supreme Governor, reveal the thoughts of the Supreme Mind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their works will be admired and understood, for the imagination of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemporaries takes this direction of its own accord.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It may be foreseen in the like manner that poets living in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ages will prefer the delineation of passions and ideas to that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons and achievements. The language, the dress, and the daily actions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of men in democracies are repugnant to ideal conceptions. These things,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are not poetical in themselves; and, if it were otherwise, they would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cease to be so, because they are too familiar to all those to whom the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,poet would speak of them. This forces the poet constantly to search,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"below the external surface which is palpable to the senses, in order to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,read the inner soul: and nothing lends itself more to the delineation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the ideal than the scrutiny of the hidden depths in the immaterial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nature of man. I need not to ramble over earth and sky to discover,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a wondrous object woven of contrasts, of greatness and littleness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"infinite, of intense gloom and of amazing brightness--capable at once","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of exciting pity, admiration, terror, contempt. I find that object in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"myself. Man springs out of nothing, crosses time, and disappears forever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the bosom of God; he is seen but for a moment, staggering on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"verge of the two abysses, and there he is lost. If man were wholly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ignorant of himself, he would have no poetry in him; for it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,impossible to describe what the mind does not conceive. If man clearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discerned his own nature, his imagination would remain idle, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would have nothing to add to the picture. But the nature of man is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sufficiently disclosed for him to apprehend something of himself; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently obscure for all the rest to be plunged in thick darkness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in which he gropes forever--and forever in vain--to lay hold on some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,completer notion of his being.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst a democratic people poetry will not be fed with legendary lays,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or the memorials of old traditions. The poet will not attempt to people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the universe with supernatural beings in whom his readers and his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fancy have ceased to believe; nor will he present virtues and vices,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the mask of frigid personification, which are better received under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own features. All these resources fail him; but Man remains, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the poet needs no more. The destinies of mankind--man himself, taken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aloof from his age and his country, and standing in the presence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nature and of God, with his passions, his doubts, his rare prosperities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and inconceivable wretchedness--will become the chief, if not the sole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,theme of poetry amongst these nations. Experience may confirm this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assertion, if we consider the productions of the greatest poets who have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,appeared since the world has been turned to democracy. The authors of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"our age who have so admirably delineated the features of Faust, Childe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Harold, Rene, and Jocelyn, did not seek to record the actions of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual, but to enlarge and to throw light on some of the obscurer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,recesses of the human heart. Such are the poems of democracy. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle of equality does not then destroy all the subjects of poetry:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it renders them less numerous, but more vast.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVIII: Of The Inflated Style Of American Writers And Orators,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have frequently remarked that the Americans, who generally treat","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of business in clear, plain language, devoid of all ornament, and so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extremely simple as to be often coarse, are apt to become inflated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as soon as they attempt a more poetical diction. They then vent their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pomposity from one end of a harangue to the other; and to hear them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lavish imagery on every occasion, one might fancy that they never spoke","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of anything with simplicity. The English are more rarely given to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,similar failing. The cause of this may be pointed out without much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficulty. In democratic communities each citizen is habitually engaged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the contemplation of a very puny object, namely himself. If he ever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"raises his looks higher, he then perceives nothing but the immense form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of society at large, or the still more imposing aspect of mankind. His","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas are all either extremely minute and clear, or extremely general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and vague: what lies between is an open void. When he has been drawn out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his own sphere, therefore, he always expects that some amazing object","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be offered to his attention; and it is on these terms alone that he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consents to tear himself for an instant from the petty complicated cares,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which form the charm and the excitement of his life. This appears to me,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently to explain why men in democracies, whose concerns are in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general so paltry, call upon their poets for conceptions so vast and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,descriptions so unlimited.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The authors, on their part, do not fail to obey a propensity of which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they themselves partake; they perpetually inflate their imaginations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and expanding them beyond all bounds, they not unfrequently abandon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the great in order to reach the gigantic. By these means they hope to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attract the observation of the multitude, and to fix it easily upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves: nor are their hopes disappointed; for as the multitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seeks for nothing in poetry but subjects of very vast dimensions, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has neither the time to measure with accuracy the proportions of all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subjects set before it, nor a taste sufficiently correct to perceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at once in what respect they are out of proportion. The author and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public at once vitiate one another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We have just seen that amongst democratic nations, the sources of poetry","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are grand, but not abundant. They are soon exhausted: and poets, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"finding the elements of the ideal in what is real and true, abandon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them entirely and create monsters. I do not fear that the poetry of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations will prove too insipid, or that it will fly too near","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the ground; I rather apprehend that it will be forever losing itself in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the clouds, and that it will range at last to purely imaginary regions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I fear that the productions of democratic poets may often be surcharged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with immense and incoherent imagery, with exaggerated descriptions and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strange creations; and that the fantastic beings of their brain may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sometimes make us regret the world of reality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIX: Some Observations On The Drama Amongst Democratic Nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the revolution which subverts the social and political state of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic people begins to penetrate into literature, it generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"first manifests itself in the drama, and it always remains conspicuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there. The spectator of a dramatic piece is, to a certain extent, taken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by surprise by the impression it conveys. He has no time to refer to his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"memory, or to consult those more able to judge than himself. It does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not occur to him to resist the new literary tendencies which begin to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be felt by him; he yields to them before he knows what they are. Authors,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are very prompt in discovering which way the taste of the public is thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secretly inclined. They shape their productions accordingly; and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literature of the stage, after having served to indicate the approaching","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literary revolution, speedily completes its accomplishment. If you would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,judge beforehand of the literature of a people which is lapsing into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy, study its dramatic productions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The literature of the stage, moreover, even amongst aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, constitutes the most democratic part of their literature.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,No kind of literary gratification is so much within the reach of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,multitude as that which is derived from theatrical representations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Neither preparation nor study is required to enjoy them: they lay hold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on you in the midst of your prejudices and your ignorance. When the yet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,untutored love of the pleasures of the mind begins to affect a class,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community, it instantly draws them to the stage. The theatres","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of aristocratic nations have always been filled with spectators not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belonging to the aristocracy. At the theatre alone the higher ranks mix,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with the middle and the lower classes; there alone do the former consent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to listen to the opinion of the latter, or at least to allow them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to give an opinion at all. At the theatre, men of cultivation and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literary attainments have always had more difficulty than elsewhere in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"making their taste prevail over that of the people, and in preventing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves from being carried away by the latter. The pit has frequently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,made laws for the boxes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If it be difficult for an aristocracy to prevent the people from getting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the upper hand in the theatre, it will readily be understood that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people will be supreme there when democratic principles have crept into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the laws and manners--when ranks are intermixed--when minds, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortunes, are brought more nearly together--and when the upper class","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has lost, with its hereditary wealth, its power, its precedents, and its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leisure. The tastes and propensities natural to democratic nations, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect to literature, will therefore first be discernible in the drama,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it may be foreseen that they will break out there with vehemence. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"written productions, the literary canons of aristocracy will be gently,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gradually, and, so to speak, legally modified; at the theatre they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be riotously overthrown. The drama brings out most of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"good qualities, and almost all the defects, inherent in democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"literature. Democratic peoples hold erudition very cheap, and care but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little for what occurred at Rome and Athens; they want to hear something,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which concerns themselves, and the delineation of the present age is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what they demand.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the heroes and the manners of antiquity are frequently brought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon the stage, and dramatic authors faithfully observe the rules of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"antiquated precedent, that is enough to warrant a conclusion that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic classes have not yet got the upper hand of the theatres.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Racine makes a very humble apology in the preface to the ""Britannicus""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for having disposed of Junia amongst the Vestals, who, according to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Aulus Gellius, he says, ""admitted no one below six years of age nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"above ten."" We may be sure that he would neither have accused himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the offence, nor defended himself from censure, if he had written for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,our contemporaries. A fact of this kind not only illustrates the state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of literature at the time when it occurred, but also that of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself. A democratic stage does not prove that the nation is in a state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of democracy, for, as we have just seen, even in aristocracies it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,happen that democratic tastes affect the drama; but when the spirit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of aristocracy reigns exclusively on the stage, the fact irrefragably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demonstrates that the whole of society is aristocratic; and it may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,boldly inferred that the same lettered and learned class which sways the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dramatic writers commands the people and governs the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The refined tastes and the arrogant bearing of an aristocracy will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rarely fail to lead it, when it manages the stage, to make a kind of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,selection in human nature. Some of the conditions of society claim,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its chief interest; and the scenes which delineate their manners are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"preferred upon the stage. Certain virtues, and even certain vices,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are thought more particularly to deserve to figure there; and they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applauded whilst all others are excluded. Upon the stage, as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as elsewhere, an aristocratic audience will only meet personages of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"quality, and share the emotions of kings. The same thing applies to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,style: an aristocracy is apt to impose upon dramatic authors certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,modes of expression which give the key in which everything is to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,delivered. By these means the stage frequently comes to delineate only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one side of man, or sometimes even to represent what is not to be met","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with in human nature at all--to rise above nature and to go beyond it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic communities the spectators have no such partialities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they rarely display any such antipathies: they like to see upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stage that medley of conditions, of feelings, and of opinions, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occurs before their eyes. The drama becomes more striking, more common,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and more true. Sometimes, however, those who write for the stage in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracies also transgress the bounds of human nature--but it is on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a different side from their predecessors. By seeking to represent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,minute detail the little singularities of the moment and the peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"characteristics of certain personages, they forget to portray the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general features of the race.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the democratic classes rule the stage, they introduce as much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,license in the manner of treating subjects as in the choice of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"As the love of the drama is, of all literary tastes, that which is most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"natural to democratic nations, the number of authors and of spectators,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as well as of theatrical representations, is constantly increasing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst these communities. A multitude composed of elements so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different, and scattered in so many different places, cannot acknowledge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same rules or submit to the same laws. No concurrence is possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst judges so numerous, who know not when they may meet again; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore each pronounces his own sentence on the piece. If the effect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democracy is generally to question the authority of all literary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rules and conventions, on the stage it abolishes them altogether, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,puts in their place nothing but the whim of each author and of each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The drama also displays in an especial manner the truth of what I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,said before in speaking more generally of style and art in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literature. In reading the criticisms which were occasioned by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dramatic productions of the age of Louis XIV, one is surprised to remark","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the great stress which the public laid on the probability of the plot,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the importance which was attached to the perfect consistency of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the characters, and to their doing nothing which could not be easily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,explained and understood. The value which was set upon the forms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"language at that period, and the paltry strife about words with which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dramatic authors were assailed, are no less surprising. It would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seem that the men of the age of Louis XIV attached very exaggerated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"importance to those details, which may be perceived in the study, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which escape attention on the stage. For, after all, the principal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of a dramatic piece is to be performed, and its chief merit is to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,affect the audience. But the audience and the readers in that age were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same: on quitting the theatre they called up the author for judgment,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to their own firesides. In democracies, dramatic pieces are listened to,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but not read. Most of those who frequent the amusements of the stage do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not go there to seek the pleasures of the mind, but the keen emotions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the heart. They do not expect to hear a fine literary work, but to see","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a play; and provided the author writes the language of his country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"correctly enough to be understood, and that his characters excite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"curiosity and awaken sympathy, the audience are satisfied. They ask no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more of fiction, and immediately return to real life. Accuracy of style","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is therefore less required, because the attentive observance of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rules is less perceptible on the stage. As for the probability of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"plot, it is incompatible with perpetual novelty, surprise, and rapidity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of invention. It is therefore neglected, and the public excuses the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neglect. You may be sure that if you succeed in bringing your audience,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into the presence of something that affects them, they will not care by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what road you brought them there; and they will never reproach you for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,having excited their emotions in spite of dramatic rules.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans very broadly display all the different propensities which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have here described when they go to the theatres; but it must be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acknowledged that as yet a very small number of them go to theatres at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all. Although playgoers and plays have prodigiously increased in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States in the last forty years, the population indulges in this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,kind of amusement with the greatest reserve. This is attributable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peculiar causes, which the reader is already acquainted with, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which a few words will suffice to remind him. The Puritans who founded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the American republics were not only enemies to amusements, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,professed an especial abhorrence for the stage. They considered it as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an abominable pastime; and as long as their principles prevailed with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undivided sway, scenic performances were wholly unknown amongst them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These opinions of the first fathers of the colony have left very deep,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,marks on the minds of their descendants. The extreme regularity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habits and the great strictness of manners which are observable in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States, have as yet opposed additional obstacles to the growth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of dramatic art. There are no dramatic subjects in a country which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"witnessed no great political catastrophes, and in which love invariably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leads by a straight and easy road to matrimony. People who spend every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day in the week in making money, and the Sunday in going to church, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing to invite the muse of Comedy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A single fact suffices to show that the stage is not very popular in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States. The Americans, whose laws allow of the utmost freedom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and even license of language in all other respects, have nevertheless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,subjected their dramatic authors to a sort of censorship. Theatrical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,performances can only take place by permission of the municipal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,authorities. This may serve to show how much communities are like,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,individuals; they surrender themselves unscrupulously to their ruling,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions, and afterwards take the greatest care not to yield too much to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the vehemence of tastes which they do not possess.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,No portion of literature is connected by closer or more numerous ties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with the present condition of society than the drama. The drama of one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"period can never be suited to the following age, if in the interval an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,important revolution has changed the manners and the laws of the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The great authors of a preceding age may be read; but pieces written,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for a different public will not be followed. The dramatic authors of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"past live only in books. The traditional taste of certain individuals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"vanity, fashion, or the genius of an actor may sustain or resuscitate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for a time the aristocratic drama amongst a democracy; but it will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speedily fall away of itself--not overthrown, but abandoned.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XX: Characteristics Of Historians In Democratic Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Historians who write in aristocratic ages are wont to refer all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occurrences to the particular will or temper of certain individuals; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are apt to attribute the most important revolutions to very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"slight accidents. They trace out the smallest causes with sagacity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and frequently leave the greatest unperceived. Historians who live in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic ages exhibit precisely opposite characteristics. Most of them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attribute hardly any influence to the individual over the destiny of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"race, nor to citizens over the fate of a people; but, on the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they assign great general causes to all petty incidents. These contrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tendencies explain each other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the historian of aristocratic ages surveys the theatre of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world, he at once perceives a very small number of prominent actors, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manage the whole piece. These great personages, who occupy the front of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the stage, arrest the observation, and fix it on themselves; and whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the historian is bent on penetrating the secret motives which make them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speak and act, the rest escape his memory. The importance of the things","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which some men are seen to do, gives him an exaggerated estimate of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influence which one man may possess; and naturally leads him to think,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that in order to explain the impulses of the multitude, it is necessary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to refer them to the particular influence of some one individual.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When, on the contrary, all the citizens are independent of one another,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and each of them is individually weak, no one is seen to exert a great,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or still less a lasting power, over the community. At first sight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,individuals appear to be absolutely devoid of any influence over it;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and society would seem to advance alone by the free and voluntary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concurrence of all the men who compose it. This naturally prompts the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind to search for that general reason which operates upon so many men's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"faculties at the same time, and turns them simultaneously in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,direction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am very well convinced that even amongst democratic nations, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"genius, the vices, or the virtues of certain individuals retard or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accelerate the natural current of a people's history: but causes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this secondary and fortuitous nature are infinitely more various, more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concealed, more complex, less powerful, and consequently less easy to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trace in periods of equality than in ages of aristocracy, when the task","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the historian is simply to detach from the mass of general events the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,particular influences of one man or of a few men. In the former case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the historian is soon wearied by the toil; his mind loses itself in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"labyrinth; and, in his inability clearly to discern or conspicuously to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"point out the influence of individuals, he denies their existence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"He prefers talking about the characteristics of race, the physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conformation of the country, or the genius of civilization, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abridges his own labors, and satisfies his reader far better at less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cost.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"M. de Lafayette says somewhere in his ""Memoirs"" that the exaggerated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,system of general causes affords surprising consolations to second-rate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"statesmen. I will add, that its effects are not less consolatory to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,second-rate historians; it can always furnish a few mighty reasons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to extricate them from the most difficult part of their work, and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indulges the indolence or incapacity of their minds, whilst it confers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon them the honors of deep thinking.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"For myself, I am of opinion that at all times one great portion of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"events of this world are attributable to general facts, and another to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,special influences. These two kinds of cause are always in operation:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their proportion only varies. General facts serve to explain more things,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic than in aristocratic ages, and fewer things are then","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assignable to special influences. At periods of aristocracy the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reverse takes place: special influences are stronger, general causes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weaker--unless indeed we consider as a general cause the fact itself of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the inequality of conditions, which allows some individuals to baffle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the natural tendencies of all the rest. The historians who seek to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"describe what occurs in democratic societies are right, therefore, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assigning much to general causes, and in devoting their chief attention","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to discover them; but they are wrong in wholly denying the special,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influence of individuals, because they cannot easily trace or follow it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The historians who live in democratic ages are not only prone to assign,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a great cause to every incident, but they are also given to connect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"incidents together, so as to deduce a system from them. In aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ages, as the attention of historians is constantly drawn to individuals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the connection of events escapes them; or rather, they do not believe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in any such connection. To them the clew of history seems every instant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"crossed and broken by the step of man. In democratic ages, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, as the historian sees much more of actions than of actors, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may easily establish some kind of sequency and methodical order amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the former. Ancient literature, which is so rich in fine historical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"compositions, does not contain a single great historical system, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the poorest of modern literatures abound with them. It would appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the ancient historians did not make sufficient use of those general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,theories which our historical writers are ever ready to carry to excess.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Those who write in democratic ages have another more dangerous tendency.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the traces of individual action upon nations are lost, it often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"happens that the world goes on to move, though the moving agent is no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,longer discoverable. As it becomes extremely difficult to discern and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to analyze the reasons which, acting separately on the volition of each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"member of the community, concur in the end to produce movement in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"old mass, men are led to believe that this movement is involuntary, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that societies unconsciously obey some superior force ruling over them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But even when the general fact which governs the private volition of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individuals is supposed to be discovered upon the earth, the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of human free-will is not secure. A cause sufficiently extensive to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affect millions of men at once, and sufficiently strong to bend them all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together in the same direction, may well seem irresistible: having seen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that mankind do yield to it, the mind is close upon the inference that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mankind cannot resist it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Historians who live in democratic ages, then, not only deny that the few","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have any power of acting upon the destiny of a people, but they deprive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people themselves of the power of modifying their own condition, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they subject them either to an inflexible Providence, or to some blind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessity. According to them, each nation is indissolubly bound by its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position, its origin, its precedents, and its character, to a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lot which no efforts can ever change. They involve generation in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"generation, and thus, going back from age to age, and from necessity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to necessity, up to the origin of the world, they forge a close and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enormous chain, which girds and binds the human race. To their minds it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is not enough to show what events have occurred: they would fain show,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that events could not have occurred otherwise. They take a nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arrived at a certain stage of its history, and they affirm that it could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not but follow the track which brought it thither. It is easier to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,make such an assertion than to show by what means the nation might have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adopted a better course.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In reading the historians of aristocratic ages, and especially those of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"antiquity, it would seem that, to be master of his lot, and to govern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his fellow-creatures, man requires only to be master of himself. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perusing the historical volumes which our age has produced, it would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seem that man is utterly powerless over himself and over all around him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The historians of antiquity taught how to command: those of our time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,teach only how to obey; in their writings the author often appears,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great, but humanity is always diminutive. If this doctrine of necessity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which is so attractive to those who write history in democratic ages,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passes from authors to their readers, till it infects the whole mass","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community and gets possession of the public mind, it will soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"paralyze the activity of modern society, and reduce Christians to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"level of the Turks. I would moreover observe, that such principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are peculiarly dangerous at the period at which we are arrived. Our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemporaries are but too prone to doubt of the human free-will,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because each of them feels himself confined on every side by his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weakness; but they are still willing to acknowledge the strength and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence of men united in society. Let not this principle be lost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sight of; for the great object in our time is to raise the faculties of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, not to complete their prostration.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XXI: Of Parliamentary Eloquence In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst aristocratic nations all the members of the community are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,connected with and dependent upon each other; the graduated scale of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different ranks acts as a tie, which keeps everyone in his proper place","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the whole body in subordination. Something of the same kind always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occurs in the political assemblies of these nations. Parties naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"range themselves under certain leaders, whom they obey by a sort of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instinct, which is only the result of habits contracted elsewhere. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,carry the manners of general society into the lesser assemblage.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In democratic countries it often happens that a great number of citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are tending to the same point; but each one only moves thither, or at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"least flatters himself that he moves, of his own accord. Accustomed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regulate his doings by personal impulse alone, he does not willingly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,submit to dictation from without. This taste and habit of independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accompany him into the councils of the nation. If he consents to connect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself with other men in the prosecution of the same purpose, at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he chooses to remain free to contribute to the common success after his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own fashion. Hence it is that in democratic countries parties are so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impatient of control, and are never manageable except in moments of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great public danger. Even then, the authority of leaders, which under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such circumstances may be able to make men act or speak, hardly ever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reaches the extent of making them keep silence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst aristocratic nations the members of political assemblies are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at the same time members of the aristocracy. Each of them enjoys high,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"established rank in his own right, and the position which he occupies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the assembly is often less important in his eyes than that which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he fills in the country. This consoles him for playing no part in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the discussion of public affairs, and restrains him from too eagerly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attempting to play an insignificant one.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America, it generally happens that a Representative only becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,somebody from his position in the Assembly. He is therefore perpetually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"haunted by a craving to acquire importance there, and he feels a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,petulant desire to be constantly obtruding his opinions upon the House.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,His own vanity is not the only stimulant which urges him on in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"course, but that of his constituents, and the continual necessity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of propitiating them. Amongst aristocratic nations a member of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,legislature is rarely in strict dependence upon his constituents: he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently to them a sort of unavoidable representative; sometimes they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are themselves strictly dependent upon him; and if at length they reject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him, he may easily get elected elsewhere, or, retiring from public life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he may still enjoy the pleasures of splendid idleness. In a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country like the United States a Representative has hardly ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a lasting hold on the minds of his constituents. However small an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"electoral body may be, the fluctuations of democracy are constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"changing its aspect; it must, therefore, be courted unceasingly. He","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is never sure of his supporters, and, if they forsake him, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,left without a resource; for his natural position is not sufficiently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elevated for him to be easily known to those not close to him; and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with the complete state of independence prevailing among the people, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot hope that his friends or the government will send him down to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,returned by an electoral body unacquainted with him. The seeds of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortune are, therefore, sown in his own neighborhood; from that nook of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"earth he must start, to raise himself to the command of a people and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to influence the destinies of the world. Thus it is natural that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic countries the members of political assemblies think more of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their constituents than of their party, whilst in aristocracies they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,think more of their party than of their constituents.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But what ought to be said to gratify constituents is not always what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ought to be said in order to serve the party to which Representatives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,profess to belong. The general interest of a party frequently demands,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that members belonging to it should not speak on great questions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they understand imperfectly; that they should speak but little on those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"minor questions which impede the great ones; lastly, and for the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part, that they should not speak at all. To keep silence is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most useful service that an indifferent spokesman can render to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commonwealth. Constituents, however, do not think so. The population of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a district sends a representative to take a part in the government of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a country, because they entertain a very lofty notion of his merits.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As men appear greater in proportion to the littleness of the objects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by which they are surrounded, it may be assumed that the opinion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entertained of the delegate will be so much the higher as talents are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more rare among his constituents. It will therefore frequently happen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the less constituents have to expect from their representative, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more they will anticipate from him; and, however incompetent he may be,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they will not fail to call upon him for signal exertions, corresponding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the rank they have conferred upon him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Independently of his position as a legislator of the State, electors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,also regard their Representative as the natural patron of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constituency in the Legislature; they almost consider him as the proxy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of each of his supporters, and they flatter themselves that he will not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be less zealous in defense of their private interests than of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the country. Thus electors are well assured beforehand that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Representative of their choice will be an orator; that he will speak,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"often if he can, and that in case he is forced to refrain, he will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strive at any rate to compress into his less frequent orations an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inquiry into all the great questions of state, combined with a statement","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of all the petty grievances they have themselves to complain to; so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, though he be not able to come forward frequently, he should on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each occasion prove what he is capable of doing; and that, instead of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually lavishing his powers, he should occasionally condense them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in a small compass, so as to furnish a sort of complete and brilliant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,epitome of his constituents and of himself. On these terms they will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vote for him at the next election. These conditions drive worthy men of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"humble abilities to despair, who, knowing their own powers, would never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"voluntarily have come forward. But thus urged on, the Representative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"begins to speak, to the great alarm of his friends; and rushing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imprudently into the midst of the most celebrated orators, he perplexes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the debate and wearies the House.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All laws which tend to make the Representative more dependent on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elector, not only affect the conduct of the legislators, as I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have remarked elsewhere, but also their language. They exercise a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"simultaneous influence on affairs themselves, and on the manner in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,affairs are discussed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is hardly a member of Congress who can make up his mind to go home,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without having despatched at least one speech to his constituents;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nor who will endure any interruption until he has introduced into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his harangue whatever useful suggestions may be made touching the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"four-and-twenty States of which the Union is composed, and especially","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the district which he represents. He therefore presents to the mind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his auditors a succession of great general truths (which he himself only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"comprehends, and expresses, confusedly), and of petty minutia, which he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is but too able to discover and to point out. The consequence is that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the debates of that great assembly are frequently vague and perplexed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and that they seem rather to drag their slow length along than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advance towards a distinct object. Some such state of things will, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"believe, always arise in the public assemblies of democracies.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Propitious circumstances and good laws might succeed in drawing to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,legislature of a democratic people men very superior to those who are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,returned by the Americans to Congress; but nothing will ever prevent the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men of slender abilities who sit there from obtruding themselves with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"complacency, and in all ways, upon the public. The evil does not appear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to me to be susceptible of entire cure, because it not only originates","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the tactics of that assembly, but in its constitution and in that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the country. The inhabitants of the United States seem themselves to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consider the matter in this light; and they show their long experience,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of parliamentary life not by abstaining from making bad speeches, but by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"courageously submitting to hear them made. They are resigned to it, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to an evil which they know to be inevitable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,We have shown the petty side of political debates in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assemblies--let us now exhibit the more imposing one. The proceedings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,within the Parliament of England for the last one hundred and fifty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,years have never occasioned any great sensation out of that country; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions and feelings expressed by the speakers have never awakened much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sympathy, even amongst the nations placed nearest to the great arena of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,British liberty; whereas Europe was excited by the very first debates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which took place in the small colonial assemblies of America at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time of the Revolution. This was attributable not only to particular,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and fortuitous circumstances, but to general and lasting causes. I can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceive nothing more admirable or more powerful than a great orator,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,debating on great questions of state in a democratic assembly. As no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,particular class is ever represented there by men commissioned to defend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its own interests, it is always to the whole nation, and in the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the whole nation, that the orator speaks. This expands his thoughts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and heightens his power of language. As precedents have there but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little weight-as there are no longer any privileges attached to certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"property, nor any rights inherent in certain bodies or in certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individuals, the mind must have recourse to general truths derived from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human nature to resolve the particular question under discussion. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the political debates of a democratic people, however small it may be,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have a degree of breadth which frequently renders them attractive to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mankind. All men are interested by them, because they treat of man, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is everywhere the same. Amongst the greatest aristocratic nations, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contrary, the most general questions are almost always argued on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"the rights of a particular class; which interest that class alone, or at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most the people amongst whom that class happens to exist. It is owing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to this, as much as to the greatness of the French people, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"favorable disposition of the nations who listen to them, that the great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,effect which the French political debates sometimes produce in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world, must be attributed. The orators of France frequently speak to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter I: Why Democratic Nations Show A More Ardent And Enduring Love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Of Equality Than Of Liberty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The first and most intense passion which is engendered by the equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conditions is, I need hardly say, the love of that same equality. My","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,readers will therefore not be surprised that I speak of its before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all others. Everybody has remarked that in our time, and especially in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"France, this passion for equality is every day gaining ground in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human heart. It has been said a hundred times that our contemporaries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are far more ardently and tenaciously attached to equality than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,freedom; but as I do not find that the causes of the fact have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently analyzed, I shall endeavor to point them out.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is possible to imagine an extreme point at which freedom and equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would meet and be confounded together. Let us suppose that all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of the community take a part in the government, and that each of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them has an equal right to take a part in it. As none is different from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his fellows, none can exercise a tyrannical power: men will be perfectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"free, because they will all be entirely equal; and they will all be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perfectly equal, because they will be entirely free. To this ideal state","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations tend. Such is the completest form that equality can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assume upon earth; but there are a thousand others which, without being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equally perfect, are not less cherished by those nations.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The principle of equality may be established in civil society, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prevailing in the political world. Equal rights may exist of indulging,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the same pleasures, of entering the same professions, of frequenting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same places--in a word, of living in the same manner and seeking","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealth by the same means, although all men do not take an equal share","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the government. A kind of equality may even be established in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"political world, though there should be no political freedom there. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man may be the equal of all his countrymen save one, who is the master","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of all without distinction, and who selects equally from among them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the agents of his power. Several other combinations might be easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagined, by which very great equality would be united to institutions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more or less free, or even to institutions wholly without freedom.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Although men cannot become absolutely equal unless they be entirely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"free, and consequently equality, pushed to its furthest extent, may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confounded with freedom, yet there is good reason for distinguishing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one from the other. The taste which men have for liberty, and that which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they feel for equality, are, in fact, two different things; and I am","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not afraid to add that, amongst democratic nations, they are two unequal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,things.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Upon close inspection, it will be seen that there is in every age some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiar and preponderating fact with which all others are connected;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this fact almost always gives birth to some pregnant idea or some ruling,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passion, which attracts to itself, and bears away in its course, all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"feelings and opinions of the time: it is like a great stream, towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which each of the surrounding rivulets seems to flow. Freedom has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,appeared in the world at different times and under various forms; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has not been exclusively bound to any social condition, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not confined to democracies. Freedom cannot, therefore, form the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distinguishing characteristic of democratic ages. The peculiar and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,preponderating fact which marks those ages as its own is the equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of conditions; the ruling passion of men in those periods is the love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of this equality. Ask not what singular charm the men of democratic ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"find in being equal, or what special reasons they may have for clinging","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,so tenaciously to equality rather than to the other advantages which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society holds out to them: equality is the distinguishing characteristic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the age they live in; that, of itself, is enough to explain that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prefer it to all the rest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But independently of this reason there are several others, which will at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all times habitually lead men to prefer equality to freedom. If a people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"could ever succeed in destroying, or even in diminishing, the equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which prevails in its own body, this could only be accomplished by long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and laborious efforts. Its social condition must be modified, its laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abolished, its opinions superseded, its habits changed, its manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,corrupted. But political liberty is more easily lost; to neglect to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hold it fast is to allow it to escape. Men therefore not only cling to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality because it is dear to them; they also adhere to it because they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,think it will last forever.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"That political freedom may compromise in its excesses the tranquillity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the property, the lives of individuals, is obvious to the narrowest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and most unthinking minds. But, on the contrary, none but attentive and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clear-sighted men perceive the perils with which equality threatens us,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they commonly avoid pointing them out. They know that the calamities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they apprehend are remote, and flatter themselves that they will only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fall upon future generations, for which the present generation takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but little thought. The evils which freedom sometimes brings with it are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immediate; they are apparent to all, and all are more or less affected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by them. The evils which extreme equality may produce are slowly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disclosed; they creep gradually into the social frame; they are only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seen at intervals, and at the moment at which they become most violent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habit already causes them to be no longer felt. The advantages which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,freedom brings are only shown by length of time; and it is always easy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to mistake the cause in which they originate. The advantages of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are instantaneous, and they may constantly be traced from their source.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Political liberty bestows exalted pleasures, from time to time, upon a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain number of citizens. Equality every day confers a number of small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enjoyments on every man. The charms of equality are every instant felt,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and are within the reach of all; the noblest hearts are not insensible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to them, and the most vulgar souls exult in them. The passion which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality engenders must therefore be at once strong and general. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot enjoy political liberty unpurchased by some sacrifices, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never obtain it without great exertions. But the pleasures of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are self-proffered: each of the petty incidents of life seems to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occasion them, and in order to taste them nothing is required but to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,live.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democratic nations are at all times fond of equality, but there are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain epochs at which the passion they entertain for it swells to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"height of fury. This occurs at the moment when the old social system,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"long menaced, completes its own destruction after a last intestine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"struggle, and when the barriers of rank are at length thrown down. At","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such times men pounce upon equality as their booty, and they cling to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it as to some precious treasure which they fear to lose. The passion for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality penetrates on every side into men's hearts, expands there,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and fills them entirely. Tell them not that by this blind surrender of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves to an exclusive passion they risk their dearest interests:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are deaf. Show them not freedom escaping from their grasp, whilst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are looking another way: they are blind--or rather, they can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discern but one sole object to be desired in the universe.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What I have said is applicable to all democratic nations: what I am,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"about to say concerns the French alone. Amongst most modern nations, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"especially amongst all those of the Continent of Europe, the taste and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the idea of freedom only began to exist and to extend themselves at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the time when social conditions were tending to equality, and as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a consequence of that very equality. Absolute kings were the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,efficient levellers of ranks amongst their subjects. Amongst these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations equality preceded freedom: equality was therefore a fact of some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,standing when freedom was still a novelty: the one had already created,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"customs, opinions, and laws belonging to it, when the other, alone and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for the first time, came into actual existence. Thus the latter was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still only an affair of opinion and of taste, whilst the former had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"already crept into the habits of the people, possessed itself of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners, and given a particular turn to the smallest actions of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lives. Can it be wondered that the men of our own time prefer the one to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the other?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it, and view any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privation of it with regret. But for equality, their passion is ardent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insatiable, incessant, invincible: they call for equality in freedom;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They will endure poverty, servitude, barbarism--but they will not endure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy. This is true at all times, and especially true in our own.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"All men and all powers seeking to cope with this irresistible passion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will be overthrown and destroyed by it. In our age, freedom cannot be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"established without it, and despotism itself cannot reign without its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,support.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter II: Of Individualism In Democratic Countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have shown how it is that in ages of equality every man seeks for his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions within himself: I am now about to show how it is that, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same ages, all his feelings are turned towards himself alone.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Individualism *a is a novel expression, to which a novel idea has given","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,birth. Our fathers were only acquainted with egotism. Egotism is a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passionate and exaggerated love of self, which leads a man to connect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everything with his own person, and to prefer himself to everything in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world. Individualism is a mature and calm feeling, which disposes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fellow-creatures; and to draw apart with his family and his friends; so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, after he has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leaves society at large to itself. Egotism originates in blind instinct:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment more than from depraved,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings; it originates as much in the deficiencies of the mind as in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the perversity of the heart. Egotism blights the germ of all virtue;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individualism, at first, only saps the virtues of public life; but,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the long run, it attacks and destroys all others, and is at length","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"absorbed in downright egotism. Egotism is a vice as old as the world,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which does not belong to one form of society more than to another:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individualism is of democratic origin, and it threatens to spread in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same ratio as the equality of conditions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote a: [I adopt the expression of the original, however strange it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may seem to the English ear, partly because it illustrates the remark","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on the introduction of general terms into democratic language which was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"made in a preceding chapter, and partly because I know of no English","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,word exactly equivalent to the expression. The chapter itself defines,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the meaning attached to it by the author.--Translator's Note.]],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst aristocratic nations, as families remain for centuries in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same condition, often on the same spot, all generations become as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were contemporaneous. A man almost always knows his forefathers, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respects them: he thinks he already sees his remote descendants, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,loves them. He willingly imposes duties on himself towards the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,former and the latter; and he will frequently sacrifice his personal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gratifications to those who went before and to those who will come after,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him. Aristocratic institutions have, moreover, the effect of closely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,binding every man to several of his fellow-citizens. As the classes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an aristocratic people are strongly marked and permanent, each of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them is regarded by its own members as a sort of lesser country,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more tangible and more cherished than the country at large. As in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic communities all the citizens occupy fixed positions, one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"above the other, the result is that each of them always sees a man above","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself whose patronage is necessary to him, and below himself another","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man whose co-operation he may claim. Men living in aristocratic ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are therefore almost always closely attached to something placed out of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own sphere, and they are often disposed to forget themselves. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is true that in those ages the notion of human fellowship is faint, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that men seldom think of sacrificing themselves for mankind; but they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"often sacrifice themselves for other men. In democratic ages, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, when the duties of each individual to the race are much more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clear, devoted service to any one man becomes more rare; the bond of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"human affection is extended, but it is relaxed.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst democratic nations new families are constantly springing up,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others are constantly falling away, and all that remain change their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition; the woof of time is every instant broken, and the track of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,generations effaced. Those who went before are soon forgotten; of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who will come after no one has any idea: the interest of man is confined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to those in close propinquity to himself. As each class approximates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to other classes, and intermingles with them, its members become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indifferent and as strangers to one another. Aristocracy had made a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chain of all the members of the community, from the peasant to the king:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy breaks that chain, and severs every link of it. As social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions become more equal, the number of persons increases who,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,although they are neither rich enough nor powerful enough to exercise,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"any great influence over their fellow-creatures, have nevertheless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acquired or retained sufficient education and fortune to satisfy their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own wants. They owe nothing to any man, they expect nothing from any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man; they acquire the habit of always considering themselves as standing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alone, and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own hands. Thus not only does democracy make every man forget,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his ancestors, but it hides his descendants, and separates his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemporaries from him; it throws him back forever upon himself alone,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and threatens in the end to confine him entirely within the solitude of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his own heart.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter III: Individualism Stronger At The Close Of A Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Revolution Than At Other Periods,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The period when the construction of democratic society upon the ruins of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an aristocracy has just been completed, is especially that at which this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"separation of men from one another, and the egotism resulting from it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most forcibly strike the observation. Democratic communities not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contain a large number of independent citizens, but they are constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"filled with men who, having entered but yesterday upon their independent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition, are intoxicated with their new power. They entertain a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"presumptuous confidence in their strength, and as they do not suppose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they can henceforward ever have occasion to claim the assistance of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their fellow-creatures, they do not scruple to show that they care for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nobody but themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"An aristocracy seldom yields without a protracted struggle, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,course of which implacable animosities are kindled between the different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes of society. These passions survive the victory, and traces of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them may be observed in the midst of the democratic confusion which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ensues. Those members of the community who were at the top of the late,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gradations of rank cannot immediately forget their former greatness;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they will long regard themselves as aliens in the midst of the newly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,composed society. They look upon all those whom this state of society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has made their equals as oppressors, whose destiny can excite no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sympathy; they have lost sight of their former equals, and feel no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"longer bound by a common interest to their fate: each of them, standing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aloof, thinks that he is reduced to care for himself alone. Those, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contrary, who were formerly at the foot of the social scale, and who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have been brought up to the common level by a sudden revolution, cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoy their newly acquired independence without secret uneasiness; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,if they meet with some of their former superiors on the same footing as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, they stand aloof from them with an expression of triumph and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of fear. It is, then, commonly at the outset of democratic society that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizens are most disposed to live apart. Democracy leads men not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,draw near to their fellow-creatures; but democratic revolutions lead,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them to shun each other, and perpetuate in a state of equality the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,animosities which the state of inequality engendered. The great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantage of the Americans is that they have arrived at a state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracy without having to endure a democratic revolution; and that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are born equal, instead of becoming so.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IV: That The Americans Combat The Effects Of Individualism By,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Free Institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Despotism, which is of a very timorous nature, is never more secure of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,continuance than when it can keep men asunder; and all is influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is commonly exerted for that purpose. No vice of the human heart is so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acceptable to it as egotism: a despot easily forgives his subjects for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not loving him, provided they do not love each other. He does not ask","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them to assist him in governing the State; it is enough that they do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aspire to govern it themselves. He stigmatizes as turbulent and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unruly spirits those who would combine their exertions to promote the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prosperity of the community, and, perverting the natural meaning of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"words, he applauds as good citizens those who have no sympathy for any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but themselves. Thus the vices which despotism engenders are precisely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those which equality fosters. These two things mutually and perniciously,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"complete and assist each other. Equality places men side by side,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unconnected by any common tie; despotism raises barriers to keep,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them asunder; the former predisposes them not to consider their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-creatures, the latter makes general indifference a sort of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,virtue.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Despotism then, which is at all times dangerous, is more particularly to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be feared in democratic ages. It is easy to see that in those same ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men stand most in need of freedom. When the members of a community are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forced to attend to public affairs, they are necessarily drawn from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the circle of their own interests, and snatched at times from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,self-observation. As soon as a man begins to treat of public affairs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in public, he begins to perceive that he is not so independent of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-men as he had at first imagined, and that, in order to obtain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their support, he must often lend them his co-operation.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the public is supreme, there is no man who does not feel the value","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of public goodwill, or who does not endeavor to court it by drawing to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself the esteem and affection of those amongst whom he is to live.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Many of the passions which congeal and keep asunder human hearts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are then obliged to retire and hide below the surface. Pride must be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dissembled; disdain dares not break out; egotism fears its own self.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Under a free government, as most public offices are elective, the men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whose elevated minds or aspiring hopes are too closely circumscribed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private life, constantly feel that they cannot do without the population","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which surrounds them. Men learn at such times to think of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-men from ambitious motives; and they frequently find it, in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manner, their interest to forget themselves.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I may here be met by an objection derived from electioneering intrigues,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the meannesses of candidates, and the calumnies of their opponents.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These are opportunities for animosity which occur the oftener the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequent elections become. Such evils are doubtless great, but they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,transient; whereas the benefits which attend them remain. The desire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of being elected may lead some men for a time to violent hostility; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this same desire leads all men in the long run mutually to support,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other; and if it happens that an election accidentally severs two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"friends, the electoral system brings a multitude of citizens permanently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together, who would always have remained unknown to each other. Freedom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engenders private animosities, but despotism gives birth to general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indifference.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans have combated by free institutions the tendency of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality to keep men asunder, and they have subdued it. The legislators","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of America did not suppose that a general representation of the whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nation would suffice to ward off a disorder at once so natural to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frame of democratic society, and so fatal: they also thought that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it would be well to infuse political life into each portion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"territory, in order to multiply to an infinite extent opportunities of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acting in concert for all the members of the community, and to make them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly feel their mutual dependence on each other. The plan was a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wise one. The general affairs of a country only engage the attention of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leading politicians, who assemble from time to time in the same places;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and as they often lose sight of each other afterwards, no lasting ties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are established between them. But if the object be to have the local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affairs of a district conducted by the men who reside there, the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons are always in contact, and they are, in a manner, forced to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquainted, and to adapt themselves to one another.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is difficult to draw a man out of his own circle to interest him in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the destiny of the State, because he does not clearly understand what","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,influence the destiny of the State can have upon his own lot. But if it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be proposed to make a road cross the end of his estate, he will see at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a glance that there is a connection between this small public affair and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his greatest private affairs; and he will discover, without its being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shown to him, the close tie which unites private to general interest.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, far more may be done by intrusting to the citizens the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,administration of minor affairs than by surrendering to them the control,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of important ones, towards interesting them in the public welfare, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,convincing them that they constantly stand in need one of the other in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order to provide for it. A brilliant achievement may win for you the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,favor of a people at one stroke; but to earn the love and respect of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the population which surrounds you, a long succession of little services","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rendered and of obscure good deeds--a constant habit of kindness, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an established reputation for disinterestedness--will be required.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Local freedom, then, which leads a great number of citizens to value the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affection of their neighbors and of their kindred, perpetually brings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men together, and forces them to help one another, in spite of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,propensities which sever them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States the more opulent citizens take great care not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stand aloof from the people; on the contrary, they constantly keep on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"easy terms with the lower classes: they listen to them, they speak to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them every day. They know that the rich in democracies always stand in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,need of the poor; and that in democratic ages you attach a poor man to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,you more by your manner than by benefits conferred. The magnitude of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such benefits, which sets off the difference of conditions, causes a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secret irritation to those who reap advantage from them; but the charm,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of simplicity of manners is almost irresistible: their affability,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"carries men away, and even their want of polish is not always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,displeasing. This truth does not take root at once in the minds of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rich. They generally resist it as long as the democratic revolution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lasts, and they do not acknowledge it immediately after that revolution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is accomplished. They are very ready to do good to the people, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they still choose to keep them at arm's length; they think that is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficient, but they are mistaken. They might spend fortunes thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without warming the hearts of the population around them;--that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"population does not ask them for the sacrifice of their money, but of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their pride.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would seem as if every imagination in the United States were upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the stretch to invent means of increasing the wealth and satisfying,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the wants of the public. The best-informed inhabitants of each district,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly use their information to discover new truths which may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,augment the general prosperity; and if they have made any such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discoveries, they eagerly surrender them to the mass of the people.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the vices and weaknesses, frequently exhibited by those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"govern in America, are closely examined, the prosperity of the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occasions--but improperly occasions--surprise. Elected magistrates do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not make the American democracy flourish; it flourishes because the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,magistrates are elective.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would be unjust to suppose that the patriotism and the zeal which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every American displays for the welfare of his fellow-citizens are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wholly insincere. Although private interest directs the greater part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of human actions in the United States as well as elsewhere, it does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not regulate them all. I must say that I have often seen Americans make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great and real sacrifices to the public welfare; and I have remarked,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a hundred instances in which they hardly ever failed to lend faithful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,support to each other. The free institutions which the inhabitants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the United States possess, and the political rights of which they make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so much use, remind every citizen, and in a thousand ways, that he lives","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in society. They every instant impress upon his mind the notion that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is the duty, as well as the interest of men, to make themselves useful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to their fellow-creatures; and as he sees no particular ground of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"animosity to them, since he is never either their master or their slave,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his heart readily leans to the side of kindness. Men attend to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interests of the public, first by necessity, afterwards by choice: what","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was intentional becomes an instinct; and by dint of working for the good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of one's fellow citizens, the habit and the taste for serving them is at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,length acquired.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Many people in France consider equality of conditions as one evil, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political freedom as a second. When they are obliged to yield to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"former, they strive at least to escape from the latter. But I contend","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that in order to combat the evils which equality may produce, there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only one effectual remedy--namely, political freedom.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter V: Of The Use Which The Americans Make Of Public Associations In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Civil Life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not propose to speak of those political associations--by the aid of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which men endeavor to defend themselves against the despotic influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of a majority--or against the aggressions of regal power. That subject I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have already treated. If each citizen did not learn, in proportion as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he individually becomes more feeble, and consequently more incapable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of preserving his freedom single-handed, to combine with his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-citizens for the purpose of defending it, it is clear that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tyranny would unavoidably increase together with equality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Those associations only which are formed in civil life, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reference to political objects, are here adverted to. The political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associations which exist in the United States are only a single feature,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the midst of the immense assemblage of associations in that country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions, constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,form associations. They have not only commercial and manufacturing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"companies, in which all take part, but associations of a thousand other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kinds--religious, moral, serious, futile, extensive, or restricted,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enormous or diminutive. The Americans make associations to give,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"entertainments, to found establishments for education, to build inns,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to construct churches, to diffuse books, to send missionaries to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the antipodes; and in this manner they found hospitals, prisons, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"schools. If it be proposed to advance some truth, or to foster some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form a society.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Wherever, at the head of some new undertaking, you see the government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in France, or a man of rank in England, in the United States you will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sure to find an association. I met with several kinds of associations in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America, of which I confess I had no previous notion; and I have often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,admired the extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"many men, and in getting them voluntarily to pursue it. I have since","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"travelled over England, whence the Americans have taken some of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,laws and many of their customs; and it seemed to me that the principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of association was by no means so constantly or so adroitly used in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that country. The English often perform great things singly; whereas the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans form associations for the smallest undertakings. It is evident,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the former people consider association as a powerful means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"action, but the latter seem to regard it as the only means they have of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acting.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus the most democratic country on the face of the earth is that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which men have in our time carried to the highest perfection the art of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuing in common the object of their common desires, and have applied","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this new science to the greatest number of purposes. Is this the result,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of accident? or is there in reality any necessary connection between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle of association and that of equality? Aristocratic communities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always contain, amongst a multitude of persons who by themselves are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powerless, a small number of powerful and wealthy citizens, each of whom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can achieve great undertakings single-handed. In aristocratic societies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men do not need to combine in order to act, because they are strongly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,held together. Every wealthy and powerful citizen constitutes the head,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a permanent and compulsory association, composed of all those who are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dependent upon him, or whom he makes subservient to the execution of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"designs. Amongst democratic nations, on the contrary, all the citizens","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are independent and feeble; they can do hardly anything by themselves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and none of them can oblige his fellow-men to lend him their assistance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They all, therefore, fall into a state of incapacity, if they do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,learn voluntarily to help each other. If men living in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,countries had no right and no inclination to associate for political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"purposes, their independence would be in great jeopardy; but they might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,long preserve their wealth and their cultivation: whereas if they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"never acquired the habit of forming associations in ordinary life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,civilization itself would be endangered. A people amongst which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,individuals should lose the power of achieving great things,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"single-handed, without acquiring the means of producing them by united","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exertions, would soon relapse into barbarism.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Unhappily, the same social condition which renders associations so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessary to democratic nations, renders their formation more difficult","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst those nations than amongst all others. When several members of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an aristocracy agree to combine, they easily succeed in doing so; as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each of them brings great strength to the partnership, the number of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members may be very limited; and when the members of an association,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are limited in number, they may easily become mutually acquainted,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"understand each other, and establish fixed regulations. The same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opportunities do not occur amongst democratic nations, where the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associated members must always be very numerous for their association to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have any power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am aware that many of my countrymen are not in the least embarrassed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by this difficulty. They contend that the more enfeebled and incompetent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the citizens become, the more able and active the government ought to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be rendered, in order that society at large may execute what individuals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can no longer accomplish. They believe this answers the whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difficulty, but I think they are mistaken. A government might perform","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the part of some of the largest American companies; and several States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of the Union, have already attempted it; but what political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,power could ever carry on the vast multitude of lesser undertakings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which the American citizens perform every day, with the assistance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the principle of association? It is easy to foresee that the time is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"drawing near when man will be less and less able to produce, of himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alone, the commonest necessaries of life. The task of the governing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power will therefore perpetually increase, and its very efforts will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extend it every day. The more it stands in the place of associations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the more will individuals, losing the notion of combining together,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,require its assistance: these are causes and effects which unceasingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engender each other. Will the administration of the country ultimately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assume the management of all the manufacturers, which no single","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizen is able to carry on? And if a time at length arrives, when, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence of the extreme subdivision of landed property, the soil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is split into an infinite number of parcels, so that it can only be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cultivated by companies of husbandmen, will it be necessary that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,head of the government should leave the helm of state to follow the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,plough? The morals and the intelligence of a democratic people would be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as much endangered as its business and manufactures, if the government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ever wholly usurped the place of private companies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human mind is developed by no other means than by the reciprocal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,influence of men upon each other. I have shown that these influences are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost null in democratic countries; they must therefore be artificially,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"created, and this can only be accomplished by associations.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the members of an aristocratic community adopt a new opinion, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conceive a new sentiment, they give it a station, as it were, beside","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, upon the lofty platform where they stand; and opinions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or sentiments so conspicuous to the eyes of the multitude are easily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,introduced into the minds or hearts of all around. In democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,countries the governing power alone is naturally in a condition to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,act in this manner; but it is easy to see that its action is always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inadequate, and often dangerous. A government can no more be competent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to keep alive and to renew the circulation of opinions and feelings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst a great people, than to manage all the speculations of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productive industry. No sooner does a government attempt to go,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beyond its political sphere and to enter upon this new track, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it exercises, even unintentionally, an insupportable tyranny; for a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government can only dictate strict rules, the opinions which it favors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are rigidly enforced, and it is never easy to discriminate between its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advice and its commands. Worse still will be the case if the government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,really believes itself interested in preventing all circulation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas; it will then stand motionless, and oppressed by the heaviness of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,voluntary torpor. Governments therefore should not be the only active,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers: associations ought, in democratic nations, to stand in lieu of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those powerful private individuals whom the equality of conditions has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,swept away.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States have taken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"up an opinion or a feeling which they wish to promote in the world,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they look out for mutual assistance; and as soon as they have found each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other out, they combine. From that moment they are no longer isolated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, but a power seen from afar, whose actions serve for an example,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and whose language is listened to. The first time I heard in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"States that 100,000 men had bound themselves publicly to abstain from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirituous liquors, it appeared to me more like a joke than a serious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engagement; and I did not at once perceive why these temperate citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,could not content themselves with drinking water by their own firesides.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I at last understood that 300,000 Americans, alarmed by the progress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of drunkenness around them, had made up their minds to patronize","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,temperance. They acted just in the same way as a man of high rank who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should dress very plainly, in order to inspire the humbler orders with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a contempt of luxury. It is probable that if these 100,000 men had lived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in France, each of them would singly have memorialized the government to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,watch the public-houses all over the kingdom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nothing, in my opinion, is more deserving of our attention than the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellectual and moral associations of America. The political and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,industrial associations of that country strike us forcibly; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others elude our observation, or if we discover them, we understand them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imperfectly, because we have hardly ever seen anything of the kind.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It must, however, be acknowledged that they are as necessary to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"American people as the former, and perhaps more so. In democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,countries the science of association is the mother of science; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,progress of all the rest depends upon the progress it has made. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the laws which rule human societies there is one which seems to be more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"precise and clear than all others. If men are to remain civilized, or to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become so, the art of associating together must grow and improve in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same ratio in which the equality of conditions is increased.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VI: Of The Relation Between Public Associations And Newspapers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When men are no longer united amongst themselves by firm and lasting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ties, it is impossible to obtain the cooperation of any great number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them, unless you can persuade every man whose concurrence you require","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that this private interest obliges him voluntarily to unite his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exertions to the exertions of all the rest. This can only be habitually,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and conveniently effected by means of a newspaper; nothing but a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,newspaper can drop the same thought into a thousand minds at the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"moment. A newspaper is an adviser who does not require to be sought, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who comes of his own accord, and talks to you briefly every day of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common weal, without distracting you from your private affairs.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Newspapers therefore become more necessary in proportion as men become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more equal, and individualism more to be feared. To suppose that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only serve to protect freedom would be to diminish their importance:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they maintain civilization. I shall not deny that in democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,countries newspapers frequently lead the citizens to launch together in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very ill-digested schemes; but if there were no newspapers there would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be no common activity. The evil which they produce is therefore much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less than that which they cure.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The effect of a newspaper is not only to suggest the same purpose to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a great number of persons, but also to furnish means for executing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common the designs which they may have singly conceived. The principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizens who inhabit an aristocratic country discern each other from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afar; and if they wish to unite their forces, they move towards each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, drawing a multitude of men after them. It frequently happens, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contrary, in democratic countries, that a great number of men who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wish or who want to combine cannot accomplish it, because as they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very insignificant and lost amidst the crowd, they cannot see, and know","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not where to find, one another. A newspaper then takes up the notion or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the feeling which had occurred simultaneously, but singly, to each of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. All are then immediately guided towards this beacon; and these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wandering minds, which had long sought each other in darkness, at length","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,meet and unite.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The newspaper brought them together, and the newspaper is still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessary to keep them united. In order that an association amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people should have any power, it must be a numerous body.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The persons of whom it is composed are therefore scattered over a wide,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extent, and each of them is detained in the place of his domicile by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"narrowness of his income, or by the small unremitting exertions by which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he earns it. Means then must be found to converse every day without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seeing each other, and to take steps in common without having met. Thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hardly any democratic association can do without newspapers. There is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequently a necessary connection between public associations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and newspapers: newspapers make associations, and associations make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,newspapers; and if it has been correctly advanced that associations will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increase in number as the conditions of men become more equal, it is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less certain that the number of newspapers increases in proportion to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that of associations. Thus it is in America that we find at the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time the greatest number of associations and of newspapers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This connection between the number of newspapers and that of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associations leads us to the discovery of a further connection between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the state of the periodical press and the form of the administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in a country; and shows that the number of newspapers must diminish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or increase amongst a democratic people, in proportion as its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,administration is more or less centralized. For amongst democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations the exercise of local powers cannot be intrusted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principal members of the community as in aristocracies. Those powers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must either be abolished, or placed in the hands of very large","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"numbers of men, who then in fact constitute an association permanently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,established by law for the purpose of administering the affairs of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain extent of territory; and they require a journal, to bring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to them every day, in the midst of their own minor concerns, some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intelligence of the state of their public weal. The more numerous local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers are, the greater is the number of men in whom they are vested by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"law; and as this want is hourly felt, the more profusely do newspapers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,abound.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The extraordinary subdivision of administrative power has much more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to do with the enormous number of American newspapers than the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political freedom of the country and the absolute liberty of the press.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If all the inhabitants of the Union had the suffrage--but a suffrage,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which should only extend to the choice of their legislators in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Congress--they would require but few newspapers, because they would only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have to act together on a few very important but very rare occasions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But within the pale of the great association of the nation, lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations have been established by law in every country, every city,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and indeed in every village, for the purposes of local administration.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The laws of the country thus compel every American to co-operate every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day of his life with some of his fellow-citizens for a common purpose,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and each one of them requires a newspaper to inform him what all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,others are doing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am of opinion that a democratic people, *a without any national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"representative assemblies, but with a great number of small local","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers, would have in the end more newspapers than another people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,governed by a centralized administration and an elective legislation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What best explains to me the enormous circulation of the daily press,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the United States, is that amongst the Americans I find the utmost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,national freedom combined with local freedom of every kind. There is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a prevailing opinion in France and England that the circulation of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,newspapers would be indefinitely increased by removing the taxes which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have been laid upon the press. This is a very exaggerated estimate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the effects of such a reform. Newspapers increase in numbers, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"according to their cheapness, but according to the more or less frequent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,want which a great number of men may feel for intercommunication and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,combination.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: I say a democratic people: the administration of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic people may be the reverse of centralized, and yet the want","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of newspapers be little felt, because local powers are then vested in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the hands of a very small number of men, who either act apart, or who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,know each other and can easily meet and come to an understanding.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In like manner I should attribute the increasing influence of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,daily press to causes more general than those by which it is commonly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,explained. A newspaper can only subsist on the condition of publishing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sentiments or principles common to a large number of men. A newspaper,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore always represents an association which is composed of its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habitual readers. This association may be more or less defined, more or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"less restricted, more or less numerous; but the fact that the newspaper","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"keeps alive, is a proof that at least the germ of such an association","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exists in the minds of its readers.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This leads me to a last reflection, with which I shall conclude this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chapter. The more equal the conditions of men become, and the less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strong men individually are, the more easily do they give way to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"current of the multitude, and the more difficult is it for them to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adhere by themselves to an opinion which the multitude discard. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,newspaper represents an association; it may be said to address each of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its readers in the name of all the others, and to exert its influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,over them in proportion to their individual weakness. The power of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,newspaper press must therefore increase as the social conditions of men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become more equal.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VII: Connection Of Civil And Political Associations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is only one country on the face of the earth where the citizens,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoy unlimited freedom of association for political purposes. This same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country is the only one in the world where the continual exercise of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"right of association has been introduced into civil life, and where all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the advantages which civilization can confer are procured by means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. In all the countries where political associations are prohibited,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,civil associations are rare. It is hardly probable that this is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"result of accident; but the inference should rather be, that there is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"natural, and perhaps a necessary, connection between these two kinds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of associations. Certain men happen to have a common interest in some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concern--either a commercial undertaking is to be managed, or some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speculation in manufactures to be tried; they meet, they combine, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thus by degrees they become familiar with the principle of association.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The greater is the multiplicity of small affairs, the more do men, even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without knowing it, acquire facility in prosecuting great undertakings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in common. Civil associations, therefore, facilitate political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"association: but, on the other hand, political association singularly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strengthens and improves associations for civil purposes. In civil life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every man may, strictly speaking, fancy that he can provide for his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wants; in politics, he can fancy no such thing. When a people, then,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have any knowledge of public life, the notion of association, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wish to coalesce, present themselves every day to the minds of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community: whatever natural repugnance may restrain men from acting in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concert, they will always be ready to combine for the sake of a party.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus political life makes the love and practice of association more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general; it imparts a desire of union, and teaches the means of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,combination to numbers of men who would have always lived apart.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Politics not only give birth to numerous associations, but to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associations of great extent. In civil life it seldom happens that any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,one interest draws a very large number of men to act in concert; much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,skill is required to bring such an interest into existence: but in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,politics opportunities present themselves every day. Now it is solely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in great associations that the general value of the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"association is displayed. Citizens who are individually powerless,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do not very clearly anticipate the strength which they may acquire by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uniting together; it must be shown to them in order to be understood.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Hence it is often easier to collect a multitude for a public purpose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than a few persons; a thousand citizens do not see what interest they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have in combining together--ten thousand will be perfectly aware of it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In politics men combine for great undertakings; and the use they make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the principle of association in important affairs practically teaches,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them that it is their interest to help each other in those of less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,moment. A political association draws a number of individuals at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same time out of their own circle: however they may be naturally kept,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"asunder by age, mind, and fortune, it places them nearer together and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brings them into contact. Once met, they can always meet again.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Men can embark in few civil partnerships without risking a portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their possessions; this is the case with all manufacturing and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,trading companies. When men are as yet but little versed in the art of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"association, and are unacquainted with its principal rules, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are afraid, when first they combine in this manner, of buying their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,experience dear. They therefore prefer depriving themselves of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,powerful instrument of success to running the risks which attend the use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of it. They are, however, less reluctant to join political associations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which appear to them to be without danger, because they adventure no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,money in them. But they cannot belong to these associations for any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,length of time without finding out how order is maintained amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"large number of men, and by what contrivance they are made to advance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"harmoniously and methodically, to the same object. Thus they learn to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"surrender their own will to that of all the rest, and to make their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exertions subordinate to the common impulse--things which it is not less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessary to know in civil than in political associations. Political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations may therefore be considered as large free schools, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the members of the community go to learn the general theory of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,association.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But even if political association did not directly contribute to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"progress of civil association, to destroy the former would be to impair","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the latter. When citizens can only meet in public for certain purposes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they regard such meetings as a strange proceeding of rare occurrence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they rarely think at all about it. When they are allowed to meet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freely for all purposes, they ultimately look upon public association","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as the universal, or in a manner the sole means, which men can employ to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accomplish the different purposes they may have in view. Every new want,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instantly revives the notion. The art of association then becomes, as I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have said before, the mother of action, studied and applied by all.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When some kinds of associations are prohibited and others allowed, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difficult to distinguish the former from the latter, beforehand. In this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"state of doubt men abstain from them altogether, and a sort of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion passes current which tends to cause any association whatsoever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be regarded as a bold and almost an illicit enterprise. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: This is more especially true when the executive government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has a discretionary power of allowing or prohibiting associations. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain associations are simply prohibited by law, and the courts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"justice have to punish infringements of that law, the evil is far less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,considerable. Then every citizen knows beforehand pretty nearly what he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has to expect. He judges himself before he is judged by the law, and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abstaining from prohibited associations, he embarks in those which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,legally sanctioned. It is by these restrictions that all free nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have always admitted that the right of association might be limited.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But if the legislature should invest a man with a power of ascertaining,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beforehand which associations are dangerous and which are useful, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should authorize him to destroy all associations in the bud or allow,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them to be formed, as nobody would be able to foresee in what cases","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associations might be established and in what cases they would be put,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"down, the spirit of association would be entirely paralyzed. The former","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of these laws would only assail certain associations; the latter would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"apply to society itself, and inflict an injury upon it. I can conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that a regular government may have recourse to the former, but I do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concede that any government has the right of enacting the latter.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is therefore chimerical to suppose that the spirit of association,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when it is repressed on some one point, will nevertheless display","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same vigor on all others; and that if men be allowed to prosecute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain undertakings in common, that is quite enough for them eagerly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to set about them. When the members of a community are allowed and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accustomed to combine for all purposes, they will combine as readily for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the lesser as for the more important ones; but if they are only allowed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to combine for small affairs, they will be neither inclined nor able","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to effect it. It is in vain that you will leave them entirely free to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prosecute their business on joint-stock account: they will hardly care,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to avail themselves of the rights you have granted to them; and, after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,having exhausted your strength in vain efforts to put down prohibited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations, you will be surprised that you cannot persuade men to form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the associations you encourage.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not say that there can be no civil associations in a country where,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political association is prohibited; for men can never live in society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without embarking in some common undertakings: but I maintain that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such a country civil associations will always be few in number, feebly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"planned, unskillfully managed, that they will never form any vast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"designs, or that they will fail in the execution of them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This naturally leads me to think that freedom of association in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political matters is not so dangerous to public tranquillity as is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supposed; and that possibly, after having agitated society for some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, it may strengthen the State in the end. In democratic countries","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"political associations are, so to speak, the only powerful persons who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aspire to rule the State. Accordingly, the governments of our time look","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon associations of this kind just as sovereigns in the Middle Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,regarded the great vassals of the Crown: they entertain a sort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instinctive abhorrence of them, and they combat them on all occasions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They bear, on the contrary, a natural goodwill to civil associations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"because they readily discover that, instead of directing the minds of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the community to public affairs, these institutions serve to divert them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from such reflections; and that, by engaging them more and more in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuit of objects which cannot be attained without public tranquillity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they deter them from revolutions. But these governments do not attend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the fact that political associations tend amazingly to multiply and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"facilitate those of a civil character, and that in avoiding a dangerous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,evil they deprive themselves of an efficacious remedy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When you see the Americans freely and constantly forming associations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for the purpose of promoting some political principle, of raising one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man to the head of affairs, or of wresting power from another, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have some difficulty in understanding that men so independent do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constantly fall into the abuse of freedom. If, on the other hand, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,survey the infinite number of trading companies which are in operation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the United States, and perceive that the Americans are on every side","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unceasingly engaged in the execution of important and difficult plans,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which the slightest revolution would throw into confusion, you will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,readily comprehend why people so well employed are by no means tempted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to perturb the State, nor to destroy that public tranquillity by which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they all profit.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Is it enough to observe these things separately, or should we not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discover the hidden tie which connects them? In their political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations, the Americans of all conditions, minds, and ages, daily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquire a general taste for association, and grow accustomed to the use","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of it. There they meet together in large numbers, they converse, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"listen to each other, and they are mutually stimulated to all sorts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,undertakings. They afterwards transfer to civil life the notions they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have thus acquired, and make them subservient to a thousand purposes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus it is by the enjoyment of a dangerous freedom that the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,learn the art of rendering the dangers of freedom less formidable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If a certain moment in the existence of a nation be selected, it is easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to prove that political associations perturb the State, and paralyze","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"productive industry; but take the whole life of a people, and it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perhaps be easy to demonstrate that freedom of association in political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,matters is favorable to the prosperity and even to the tranquillity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I said in the former part of this work, ""The unrestrained liberty of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the press. The one is at the same time less necessary and more dangerous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than the other. A nation may confine it within certain limits without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ceasing to be mistress of itself; and it may sometimes be obliged to do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so in order to maintain its own authority."" And further on I added:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political purposes is the last degree of liberty which a people is fit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for. If it does not throw them into anarchy, it perpetually brings them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as it were, to the verge of it."" Thus I do not think that a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is always at liberty to invest its citizens with an absolute right of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"association for political purposes; and I doubt whether, in any country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or in any age, it be wise to set no limits to freedom of association.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A certain nation, it is said, could not maintain tranquillity in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, cause the laws to be respected, or establish a lasting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government, if the right of association were not confined within narrow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"limits. These blessings are doubtless invaluable, and I can imagine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, to acquire or to preserve them, a nation may impose upon itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,severe temporary restrictions: but still it is well that the nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should know at what price these blessings are purchased. I can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understand that it may be advisable to cut off a man's arm in order to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,save his life; but it would be ridiculous to assert that he will be as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dexterous as he was before he lost it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VIII: The Americans Combat Individualism By The Principle Of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Interest Rightly Understood,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the world was managed by a few rich and powerful individuals, these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persons loved to entertain a lofty idea of the duties of man. They were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fond of professing that it is praiseworthy to forget one's self, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that good should be done without hope of reward, as it is by the Deity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself. Such were the standard opinions of that time in morals. I doubt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whether men were more virtuous in aristocratic ages than in others; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they were incessantly talking of the beauties of virtue, and its utility","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was only studied in secret. But since the imagination takes less lofty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"flights and every man's thoughts are centred in himself, moralists are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alarmed by this idea of self-sacrifice, and they no longer venture to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,present it to the human mind. They therefore content themselves with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inquiring whether the personal advantage of each member of the community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does not consist in working for the good of all; and when they have hit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon some point on which private interest and public interest meet and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amalgamate, they are eager to bring it into notice. Observations of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,kind are gradually multiplied: what was only a single remark becomes a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general principle; and it is held as a truth that man serves himself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in serving his fellow-creatures, and that his private interest is to do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,good.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have already shown, in several parts of this work, by what means the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inhabitants of the United States almost always manage to combine their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own advantage with that of their fellow-citizens: my present purpose is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to point out the general rule which enables them to do so. In the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States hardly anybody talks of the beauty of virtue; but they maintain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that virtue is useful, and prove it every day. The American moralists","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do not profess that men ought to sacrifice themselves for their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fellow-creatures because it is noble to make such sacrifices; but they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,boldly aver that such sacrifices are as necessary to him who imposes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them upon himself as to him for whose sake they are made. They have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,found out that in their country and their age man is brought home to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself by an irresistible force; and losing all hope of stopping,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that force, they turn all their thoughts to the direction of it. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore do not deny that every man may follow his own interest;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but they endeavor to prove that it is the interest of every man to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtuous. I shall not here enter into the reasons they allege, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would divert me from my subject: suffice it to say that they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,convinced their fellow-countrymen.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Montaigne said long ago: ""Were I not to follow the straight road for its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"straightness, I should follow it for having found by experience that in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the end it is commonly the happiest and most useful track."" The doctrine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of interest rightly understood is not, then, new, but amongst the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans of our time it finds universal acceptance: it has become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"popular there; you may trace it at the bottom of all their actions, you","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will remark it in all they say. It is as often to be met with on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lips of the poor man as of the rich. In Europe the principle of interest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is much grosser than it is in America, but at the same time it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"less common, and especially it is less avowed; amongst us, men still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly feign great abnegation which they no longer feel. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans, on the contrary, are fond of explaining almost all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,actions of their lives by the principle of interest rightly understood;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they show with complacency how an enlightened regard for themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constantly prompts them to assist each other, and inclines them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,welfare of the State. In this respect I think they frequently fail to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do themselves justice; for in the United States, as well as elsewhere,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people are sometimes seen to give way to those disinterested and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spontaneous impulses which are natural to man; but the Americans seldom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,allow that they yield to emotions of this kind; they are more anxious to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do honor to their philosophy than to themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I might here pause, without attempting to pass a judgment on what I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"described. The extreme difficulty of the subject would be my excuse,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but I shall not avail myself of it; and I had rather that my readers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clearly perceiving my object, should refuse to follow me than that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I should leave them in suspense. The principle of interest rightly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"understood is not a lofty one, but it is clear and sure. It does not aim","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at mighty objects, but it attains without excessive exertion all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those at which it aims. As it lies within the reach of all capacities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everyone can without difficulty apprehend and retain it. By its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"admirable conformity to human weaknesses, it easily obtains great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dominion; nor is that dominion precarious, since the principle checks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one personal interest by another, and uses, to direct the passions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the very same instrument which excites them. The principle of interest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rightly understood produces no great acts of self-sacrifice, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,suggests daily small acts of self-denial. By itself it cannot suffice to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"make a man virtuous, but it disciplines a number of citizens in habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of regularity, temperance, moderation, foresight, self-command; and, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will, it gradually draws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them in that direction by their habits. If the principle of interest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world, extraordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,virtues would doubtless be more rare; but I think that gross depravity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would then also be less common. The principle of interest rightly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understood perhaps prevents some men from rising far above the level of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mankind; but a great number of other men, who were falling far below it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are caught and restrained by it. Observe some few individuals, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lowered by it; survey mankind, it is raised. I am not afraid to say that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the principle of interest, rightly understood, appears to me the best","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, and that I regard it as their chief remaining security against","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves. Towards it, therefore, the minds of the moralists of our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"age should turn; even should they judge it to be incomplete, it must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nevertheless be adopted as necessary.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not think upon the whole that there is more egotism amongst us than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in America; the only difference is, that there it is enlightened--here","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is not. Every American will sacrifice a portion of his private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interests to preserve the rest; we would fain preserve the whole, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,oftentimes the whole is lost. Everybody I see about me seems bent on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"teaching his contemporaries, by precept and example, that what is useful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is never wrong. Will nobody undertake to make them understand how what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is right may be useful? No power upon earth can prevent the increasing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality of conditions from inclining the human mind to seek out what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"useful, or from leading every member of the community to be wrapped up","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in himself. It must therefore be expected that personal interest will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become more than ever the principal, if not the sole, spring of men's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,actions; but it remains to be seen how each man will understand his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"personal interest. If the members of a community, as they become more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, become more ignorant and coarse, it is difficult to foresee to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what pitch of stupid excesses their egotism may lead them; and no one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can foretell into what disgrace and wretchedness they would plunge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, lest they should have to sacrifice something of their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well-being to the prosperity of their fellow-creatures. I do not think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the system of interest, as it is professed in America, is, in all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its parts, self-evident; but it contains a great number of truths so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"evident that men, if they are but educated, cannot fail to see them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Educate, then, at any rate; for the age of implicit self-sacrifice and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instinctive virtues is already flitting far away from us, and the time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is fast approaching when freedom, public peace, and social order itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will not be able to exist without education.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IX: That The Americans Apply The Principle Of Interest Rightly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Understood To Religious Matters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If the principle of interest rightly understood had nothing but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"present world in view, it would be very insufficient; for there are many","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sacrifices which can only find their recompense in another; and whatever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ingenuity may be put forth to demonstrate the utility of virtue, it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never be an easy task to make that man live aright who has no thoughts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of dying. It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether the principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of interest rightly understood is easily compatible with religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief. The philosophers who inculcate this system of morals tell men,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that to be happy in this life they must watch their own passions and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,steadily control their excess; that lasting happiness can only be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secured by renouncing a thousand transient gratifications; and that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man must perpetually triumph over himself, in order to secure his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantage. The founders of almost all religions have held the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"language. The track they point out to man is the same, only that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,goal is more remote; instead of placing in this world the reward of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sacrifices they impose, they transport it to another. Nevertheless I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot believe that all those who practise virtue from religious motives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are only actuated by the hope of a recompense. I have known zealous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Christians who constantly forgot themselves, to work with greater ardor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for the happiness of their fellow-men; and I have heard them declare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that all they did was only to earn the blessings of a future state. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot but think that they deceive themselves; I respect them too much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to believe them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Christianity indeed teaches that a man must prefer his neighbor to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself, in order to gain eternal life; but Christianity also teaches","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that men ought to benefit their fellow-creatures for the love of God.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A sublime expression! Man, searching by his intellect into the divine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conception, and seeing that order is the purpose of God, freely combines","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to prosecute the great design; and whilst he sacrifices his personal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interests to this consummate order of all created things, expects no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other recompense than the pleasure of contemplating it. I do not believe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that interest is the sole motive of religious men: but I believe that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interest is the principal means which religions themselves employ to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"govern men, and I do not question that this way they strike into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,multitude and become popular. It is not easy clearly to perceive why,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the principle of interest rightly understood should keep aloof from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religious opinions; and it seems to me more easy to show why it should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"draw men to them. Let it be supposed that, in order to obtain happiness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in this world, a man combats his instinct on all occasions and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"deliberately calculates every action of his life; that, instead of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"yielding blindly to the impetuosity of first desires, he has learned the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"art of resisting them, and that he has accustomed himself to sacrifice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without an effort the pleasure of a moment to the lasting interest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his whole life. If such a man believes in the religion which he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"professes, it will cost him but little to submit to the restrictions it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may impose. Reason herself counsels him to obey, and habit has prepared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him to endure them. If he should have conceived any doubts as to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of his hopes, still he will not easily allow himself to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stopped by them; and he will decide that it is wise to risk some of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advantages of this world, in order to preserve his rights to the great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inheritance promised him in another. ""To be mistaken in believing that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Christian religion is true,"" says Pascal, ""is no great loss to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"anyone; but how dreadful to be mistaken in believing it to be false!""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans do not affect a brutal indifference to a future state;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they affect no puerile pride in despising perils which they hope to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,escape from. They therefore profess their religion without shame and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without weakness; but there generally is, even in their zeal, something","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so indescribably tranquil, methodical, and deliberate, that it would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seem as if the head, far more than the heart, brought them to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,foot of the altar. The Americans not only follow their religion from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interest, but they often place in this world the interest which makes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them follow it. In the Middle Ages the clergy spoke of nothing but a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,future state; they hardly cared to prove that a sincere Christian may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be a happy man here below. But the American preachers are constantly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,referring to the earth; and it is only with great difficulty that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can divert their attention from it. To touch their congregations, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always show them how favorable religious opinions are to freedom and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public tranquillity; and it is often difficult to ascertain from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discourses whether the principal object of religion is to procure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eternal felicity in the other world, or prosperity in this.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter X: Of The Taste For Physical Well-Being In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America the passion for physical well-being is not always exclusive,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but it is general; and if all do not feel it in the same manner, yet it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is felt by all. Carefully to satisfy all, even the least wants of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"body, and to provide the little conveniences of life, is uppermost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in every mind. Something of an analogous character is more and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,apparent in Europe. Amongst the causes which produce these similar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequences in both hemispheres, several are so connected with my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,subject as to deserve notice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When riches are hereditarily fixed in families, there are a great number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of men who enjoy the comforts of life without feeling an exclusive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taste for those comforts. The heart of man is not so much caught by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undisturbed possession of anything valuable as by the desire, as yet","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imperfectly satisfied, of possessing it, and by the incessant dread","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of losing it. In aristocratic communities, the wealthy, never having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"experienced a condition different from their own, entertain no fear of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,changing it; the existence of such conditions hardly occurs to them. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"comforts of life are not to them the end of life, but simply a way of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"living; they regard them as existence itself--enjoyed, but scarcely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thought of. As the natural and instinctive taste which all men feel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for being well off is thus satisfied without trouble and without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"apprehension, their faculties are turned elsewhere, and cling to more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arduous and more lofty undertakings, which excite and engross their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"minds. Hence it is that, in the midst of physical gratifications, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of an aristocracy often display a haughty contempt of these very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enjoyments, and exhibit singular powers of endurance under the privation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of them. All the revolutions which have ever shaken or destroyed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracies, have shown how easily men accustomed to superfluous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,luxuries can do without the necessaries of life; whereas men who have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,toiled to acquire a competency can hardly live after they have lost it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If I turn my observation from the upper to the lower classes, I find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,analogous effects produced by opposite causes. Amongst a nation where,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy predominates in society, and keeps it stationary, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people in the end get as much accustomed to poverty as the rich to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their opulence. The latter bestow no anxiety on their physical comforts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because they enjoy them without an effort; the former do not think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of things which they despair of obtaining, and which they hardly know","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enough of to desire them. In communities of this kind, the imagination","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the poor is driven to seek another world; the miseries of real life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inclose it around, but it escapes from their control, and flies to seek","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its pleasures far beyond. When, on the contrary, the distinctions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of ranks are confounded together and privileges are destroyed--when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hereditary property is subdivided, and education and freedom widely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diffused, the desire of acquiring the comforts of the world haunts the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagination of the poor, and the dread of losing them that of the rich.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Many scanty fortunes spring up; those who possess them have a sufficient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,share of physical gratifications to conceive a taste for these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures--not enough to satisfy it. They never procure them without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exertion, and they never indulge in them without apprehension. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are therefore always straining to pursue or to retain gratifications so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"delightful, so imperfect, so fugitive.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If I were to inquire what passion is most natural to men who are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stimulated and circumscribed by the obscurity of their birth or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mediocrity of their fortune, I could discover none more peculiarly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,appropriate to their condition than this love of physical prosperity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The passion for physical comforts is essentially a passion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"middle classes: with those classes it grows and spreads, with them it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"preponderates. From them it mounts into the higher orders of society,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and descends into the mass of the people. I never met in America with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,any citizen so poor as not to cast a glance of hope and envy on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enjoyments of the rich, or whose imagination did not possess itself by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,anticipation of those good things which fate still obstinately withheld,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from him. On the other hand, I never perceived amongst the wealthier","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inhabitants of the United States that proud contempt of physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gratifications which is sometimes to be met with even in the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opulent and dissolute aristocracies. Most of these wealthy persons were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,once poor; they have felt the sting of want; they were long a prey to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adverse fortunes; and now that the victory is won, the passions which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accompanied the contest have survived it: their minds are, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intoxicated by the small enjoyments which they have pursued for forty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"years. Not but that in the United States, as elsewhere, there are a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain number of wealthy persons who, having come into their property","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by inheritance, possess, without exertion, an opulence they have not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,earned. But even these men are not less devotedly attached to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures of material life. The love of well-being is now become the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,predominant taste of the nation; the great current of man's passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"runs in that channel, and sweeps everything along in its course.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XI: Peculiar Effects Of The Love Of Physical Gratifications In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It may be supposed, from what has just been said, that the love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of physical gratifications must constantly urge the Americans to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"irregularities in morals, disturb the peace of families, and threaten","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the security of society at large. Such is not the case: the passion for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,physical gratifications produces in democracies effects very different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from those which it occasions in aristocratic nations. It sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"happens that, wearied with public affairs and sated with opulence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amidst the ruin of religious belief and the decline of the State, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,heart of an aristocracy may by degrees be seduced to the pursuit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sensual enjoyments only. At other times the power of the monarch or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"weakness of the people, without stripping the nobility of their fortune,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"compels them to stand aloof from the administration of affairs, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst the road to mighty enterprise is closed, abandons them to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inquietude of their own desires; they then fall back heavily upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, and seek in the pleasures of the body oblivion of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,former greatness. When the members of an aristocratic body are thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exclusively devoted to the pursuit of physical gratifications, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,commonly concentrate in that direction all the energy which they derive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from their long experience of power. Such men are not satisfied with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the pursuit of comfort; they require sumptuous depravity and splendid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,corruption. The worship they pay the senses is a gorgeous one; and they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seem to vie with each other in the art of degrading their own natures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The stronger, the more famous, and the more free an aristocracy has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been, the more depraved will it then become; and however brilliant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may have been the lustre of its virtues, I dare predict that they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always be surpassed by the splendor of its vices.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The taste for physical gratifications leads a democratic people into no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such excesses. The love of well-being is there displayed as a tenacious,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exclusive, universal passion; but its range is confined. To build","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enormous palaces, to conquer or to mimic nature, to ransack the world in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order to gratify the passions of a man, is not thought of: but to add","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a few roods of land to your field, to plant an orchard, to enlarge a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dwelling, to be always making life more comfortable and convenient,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to avoid trouble, and to satisfy the smallest wants without effort and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost without cost. These are small objects, but the soul clings to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them; it dwells upon them closely and day by day, till they at last shut","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"out the rest of the world, and sometimes intervene between itself and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,heaven.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This, it may be said, can only be applicable to those members of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community who are in humble circumstances; wealthier individuals will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,display tastes akin to those which belonged to them in aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ages. I contest the proposition: in point of physical gratifications,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the most opulent members of a democracy will not display tastes very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different from those of the people; whether it be that, springing from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people, they really share those tastes, or that they esteem it a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,duty to submit to them. In democratic society the sensuality of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public has taken a moderate and tranquil course, to which all are bound","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to conform: it is as difficult to depart from the common rule by one's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vices as by one's virtues. Rich men who live amidst democratic nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are therefore more intent on providing for their smallest wants than for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their extraordinary enjoyments; they gratify a number of petty desires,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without indulging in any great irregularities of passion: thus they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more apt to become enervated than debauched. The especial taste which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the men of democratic ages entertain for physical enjoyments is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally opposed to the principles of public order; nay, it often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stands in need of order that it may be gratified. Nor is it adverse to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regularity of morals, for good morals contribute to public tranquillity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and are favorable to industry. It may even be frequently combined with a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,species of religious morality: men wish to be as well off as they can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in this world, without foregoing their chance of another. Some physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gratifications cannot be indulged in without crime; from such they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strictly abstain. The enjoyment of others is sanctioned by religion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and morality; to these the heart, the imagination, and life itself are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unreservedly given up; till, in snatching at these lesser gifts, men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lose sight of those more precious possessions which constitute the glory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the greatness of mankind. The reproach I address to the principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of equality, is not that it leads men away in the pursuit of forbidden","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enjoyments, but that it absorbs them wholly in quest of those which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"allowed. By these means, a kind of virtuous materialism may ultimately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be established in the world, which would not corrupt, but enervate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soul, and noiselessly unbend its springs of action.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Although the desire of acquiring the good things of this world is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prevailing passion of the American people, certain momentary outbreaks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occur, when their souls seem suddenly to burst the bonds of matter by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they are restrained, and to soar impetuously towards heaven. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the States of the Union, but especially in the half-peopled country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the Far West, wandering preachers may be met with who hawk about the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"word of God from place to place. Whole families--old men, women, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"children--cross rough passes and untrodden wilds, coming from a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distance, to join a camp-meeting, where they totally forget for several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"days and nights, in listening to these discourses, the cares of business","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and even the most urgent wants of the body. Here and there, in the midst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of American society, you meet with men, full of a fanatical and almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wild enthusiasm, which hardly exists in Europe. From time to time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strange sects arise, which endeavor to strike out extraordinary paths","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to eternal happiness. Religious insanity is very common in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nor ought these facts to surprise us. It was not man who implanted in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself the taste for what is infinite and the love of what is immortal:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those lofty instincts are not the offspring of his capricious will;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their steadfast foundation is fixed in human nature, and they exist in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spite of his efforts. He may cross and distort them--destroy them he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot. The soul has wants which must be satisfied; and whatever pains,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be taken to divert it from itself, it soon grows weary, restless, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disquieted amidst the enjoyments of sense. If ever the faculties of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the great majority of mankind were exclusively bent upon the pursuit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"material objects, it might be anticipated that an amazing reaction would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take place in the souls of some men. They would drift at large in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world of spirits, for fear of remaining shackled by the close bondage of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the body.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is not then wonderful if, in the midst of a community whose thoughts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tend earthward, a small number of individuals are to be found who turn","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their looks to heaven. I should be surprised if mysticism did not soon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,make some advance amongst a people solely engaged in promoting its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,worldly welfare. It is said that the deserts of the Thebaid were peopled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the persecutions of the emperors and the massacres of the Circus; I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should rather say that it was by the luxuries of Rome and the Epicurean,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"philosophy of Greece. If their social condition, their present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"circumstances, and their laws did not confine the minds of the Americans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so closely to the pursuit of worldly welfare, it is probable that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would display more reserve and more experience whenever their attention,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is turned to things immaterial, and that they would check themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without difficulty. But they feel imprisoned within bounds which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will apparently never be allowed to pass. As soon as they have passed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these bounds, their minds know not where to fix themselves, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,often rush unrestrained beyond the range of common-sense.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Their Prosperity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In certain remote corners of the Old World you may still sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stumble upon a small district which seems to have been forgotten amidst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the general tumult, and to have remained stationary whilst everything","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,around it was in motion. The inhabitants are for the most part extremely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ignorant and poor; they take no part in the business of the country, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are frequently oppressed by the government; yet their countenances,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are generally placid, and their spirits light. In America I saw the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freest and most enlightened men, placed in the happiest circumstances","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which the world affords: it seemed to me as if a cloud habitually hung,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon their brow, and I thought them serious and almost sad even in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures. The chief reason of this contrast is that the former do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,think of the ills they endure--the latter are forever brooding over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantages they do not possess. It is strange to see with what feverish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ardor the Americans pursue their own welfare; and to watch the vague,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dread that constantly torments them lest they should not have chosen the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shortest path which may lead to it. A native of the United States clings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to this world's goods as if he were certain never to die; and he is so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hasty in grasping at all within his reach, that one would suppose he was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly afraid of not living long enough to enjoy them. He clutches,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everything, he holds nothing fast, but soon loosens his grasp to pursue","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fresh gratifications.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States a man builds a house to spend his latter years in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it, and he sells it before the roof is on: he plants a garden, and lets","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it just as the trees are coming into bearing: he brings a field into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tillage, and leaves other men to gather the crops: he embraces a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"profession, and gives it up: he settles in a place, which he soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afterwards leaves, to carry his changeable longings elsewhere. If his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private affairs leave him any leisure, he instantly plunges into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vortex of politics; and if at the end of a year of unremitting labor he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"finds he has a few days' vacation, his eager curiosity whirls him over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the vast extent of the United States, and he will travel fifteen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hundred miles in a few days, to shake off his happiness. Death at length","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"overtakes him, but it is before he is weary of his bootless chase of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that complete felicity which is forever on the wing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,At first sight there is something surprising in this strange unrest of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so many happy men, restless in the midst of abundance. The spectacle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself is however as old as the world; the novelty is to see a whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people furnish an exemplification of it. Their taste for physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gratifications must be regarded as the original source of that secret,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inquietude which the actions of the Americans betray, and of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inconstancy of which they afford fresh examples every day. He who has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,set his heart exclusively upon the pursuit of worldly welfare is always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in a hurry, for he has but a limited time at his disposal to reach it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to grasp it, and to enjoy it. The recollection of the brevity of life is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a constant spur to him. Besides the good things which he possesses, he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every instant fancies a thousand others which death will prevent him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from trying if he does not try them soon. This thought fills him with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"anxiety, fear, and regret, and keeps his mind in ceaseless trepidation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which leads him perpetually to change his plans and his abode. If in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,addition to the taste for physical well-being a social condition be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superadded, in which the laws and customs make no condition permanent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,here is a great additional stimulant to this restlessness of temper. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will then be seen continually to change their track, for fear of missing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the shortest cut to happiness. It may readily be conceived that if men,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passionately bent upon physical gratifications, desire eagerly, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"also easily discouraged: as their ultimate object is to enjoy, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"means to reach that object must be prompt and easy, or the trouble of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acquiring the gratification would be greater than the gratification,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself. Their prevailing frame of mind then is at once ardent and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"relaxed, violent and enervated. Death is often less dreaded than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perseverance in continuous efforts to one end.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The equality of conditions leads by a still straighter road to several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the effects which I have here described. When all the privileges of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"birth and fortune are abolished, when all professions are accessible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to all, and a man's own energies may place him at the top of any one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them, an easy and unbounded career seems open to his ambition, and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will readily persuade himself that he is born to no vulgar destinies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But this is an erroneous notion, which is corrected by daily experience.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The same equality which allows every citizen to conceive these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lofty hopes, renders all the citizens less able to realize them: it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"circumscribes their powers on every side, whilst it gives freer scope to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their desires. Not only are they themselves powerless, but they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"met at every step by immense obstacles, which they did not at first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perceive. They have swept away the privileges of some of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fellow-creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to universal competition: the barrier has changed its shape rather than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its position. When men are nearly alike, and all follow the same track,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is very difficult for any one individual to walk quick and cleave,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a way through the dense throng which surrounds and presses him. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constant strife between the propensities springing from the equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conditions and the means it supplies to satisfy them, harasses and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wearies the mind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is possible to conceive men arrived at a degree of freedom which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should completely content them; they would then enjoy their independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without anxiety and without impatience. But men will never establish any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality with which they can be contented. Whatever efforts a people may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"make, they will never succeed in reducing all the conditions of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to a perfect level; and even if they unhappily attained that absolute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and complete depression, the inequality of minds would still remain,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which, coming directly from the hand of God, will forever escape the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,laws of man. However democratic then the social state and the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitution of a people may be, it is certain that every member of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community will always find out several points about him which command,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his own position; and we may foresee that his looks will be doggedly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fixed in that direction. When inequality of conditions is the common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"law of society, the most marked inequalities do not strike the eye: when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everything is nearly on the same level, the slightest are marked enough","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to hurt it. Hence the desire of equality always becomes more insatiable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in proportion as equality is more complete.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst democratic nations men easily attain a certain equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of conditions: they can never attain the equality they desire. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually retires from before them, yet without hiding itself from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their sight, and in retiring draws them on. At every moment they think","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are about to grasp it; it escapes at every moment from their hold.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They are near enough to see its charms, but too far off to enjoy them;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and before they have fully tasted its delights they die. To these causes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must be attributed that strange melancholy which oftentimes will haunt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the inhabitants of democratic countries in the midst of their abundance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and that disgust at life which sometimes seizes upon them in the midst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of calm and easy circumstances. Complaints are made in France that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of suicides increases; in America suicide is rare, but insanity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is said to be more common than anywhere else. These are all different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,symptoms of the same disease. The Americans do not put an end to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lives, however disquieted they may be, because their religion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forbids it; and amongst them materialism may be said hardly to exist,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notwithstanding the general passion for physical gratification. The will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resists--reason frequently gives way. In democratic ages enjoyments are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more intense than in the ages of aristocracy, and especially the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those who partake in them is larger: but, on the other hand, it must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be admitted that man's hopes and his desires are oftener blasted, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soul is more stricken and perturbed, and care itself more keen.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIV: Taste For Physical Gratifications United In America To Love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Of Freedom And Attention To Public Affairs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When a democratic state turns to absolute monarchy, the activity which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was before directed to public and to private affairs is all at once,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centred upon the latter: the immediate consequence is, for some time,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great physical prosperity; but this impulse soon slackens, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amount of productive industry is checked. I know not if a single trading,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or manufacturing people can be cited, from the Tyrians down to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Florentines and the English, who were not a free people also. There","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is therefore a close bond and necessary relation between these two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,elements--freedom and productive industry. This proposition is generally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"true of all nations, but especially of democratic nations. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,already shown that men who live in ages of equality continually require,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to form associations in order to procure the things they covet; and, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other hand, I have shown how great political freedom improves and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diffuses the art of association. Freedom, in these ages, is therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,especially favorable to the production of wealth; nor is it difficult,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to perceive that despotism is especially adverse to the same result.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The nature of despotic power in democratic ages is not to be fierce or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cruel, but minute and meddling. Despotism of this kind, though it does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not trample on humanity, is directly opposed to the genius of commerce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the pursuits of industry.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus the men of democratic ages require to be free in order more readily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to procure those physical enjoyments for which they are always longing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It sometimes happens, however, that the excessive taste they conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for these same enjoyments abandons them to the first master who appears.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The passion for worldly welfare then defeats itself, and, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perceiving it, throws the object of their desires to a greater distance.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"There is, indeed, a most dangerous passage in the history of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic people. When the taste for physical gratifications amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such a people has grown more rapidly than their education and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"experience of free institutions, the time will come when men are carried","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"away, and lose all self-restraint, at the sight of the new possessions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are about to lay hold upon. In their intense and exclusive anxiety,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to make a fortune, they lose sight of the close connection which exists","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is not necessary to do violence to such a people in order to strip,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them of the rights they enjoy; they themselves willingly loosen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their hold. The discharge of political duties appears to them to be a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"troublesome annoyance, which diverts them from their occupations and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"business. If they be required to elect representatives, to support the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Government by personal service, to meet on public business, they have no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time--they cannot waste their precious time in useless engagements: such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,idle amusements are unsuited to serious men who are engaged with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more important interests of life. These people think they are following,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the principle of self-interest, but the idea they entertain of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle is a very rude one; and the better to look after what they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"call their business, they neglect their chief business, which is to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remain their own masters.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"As the citizens who work do not care to attend to public business, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as the class which might devote its leisure to these duties has ceased,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to exist, the place of the Government is, as it were, unfilled. If at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that critical moment some able and ambitious man grasps the supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power, he will find the road to every kind of usurpation open before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him. If he does but attend for some time to the material prosperity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the country, no more will be demanded of him. Above all he must insure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public tranquillity: men who are possessed by the passion of physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gratification generally find out that the turmoil of freedom disturbs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their welfare, before they discover how freedom itself serves to promote","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. If the slightest rumor of public commotion intrudes into the petty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasures of private life, they are aroused and alarmed by it. The fear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of anarchy perpetually haunts them, and they are always ready to fling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,away their freedom at the first disturbance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I readily admit that public tranquillity is a great good; but at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same time I cannot forget that all nations have been enslaved by being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,kept in good order. Certainly it is not to be inferred that nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ought to despise public tranquillity; but that state ought not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,content them. A nation which asks nothing of its government but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,maintenance of order is already a slave at heart--the slave of its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well-being, awaiting but the hand that will bind it. By such a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the despotism of faction is not less to be dreaded than the despotism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an individual. When the bulk of the community is engrossed by private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concerns, the smallest parties need not despair of getting the upper","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hand in public affairs. At such times it is not rare to see upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the great stage of the world, as we see at our theatres, a multitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"represented by a few players, who alone speak in the name of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,absent or inattentive crowd: they alone are in action whilst all are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stationary; they regulate everything by their own caprice; they change,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the laws, and tyrannize at will over the manners of the country; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,then men wonder to see into how small a number of weak and worthless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hands a great people may fall.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Hitherto the Americans have fortunately escaped all the perils which I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have just pointed out; and in this respect they are really deserving of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,admiration. Perhaps there is no country in the world where fewer idle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men are to be met with than in America, or where all who work are more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,eager to promote their own welfare. But if the passion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans for physical gratifications is vehement, at least it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not indiscriminating; and reason, though unable to restrain it, still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,directs its course. An American attends to his private concerns as if he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were alone in the world, and the next minute he gives himself up to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common weal as if he had forgotten them. At one time he seems animated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the most selfish cupidity, at another by the most lively patriotism.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The human heart cannot be thus divided. The inhabitants of the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States alternately display so strong and so similar a passion for their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own welfare and for their freedom, that it may be supposed that these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passions are united and mingled in some part of their character. And,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indeed the Americans believe their freedom to be the best instrument and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,surest safeguard of their welfare: they are attached to the one by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other. They by no means think that they are not called upon to take a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part in the public weal; they believe, on the contrary, that their chief","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,business is to secure for themselves a government which will allow them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to acquire the things they covet, and which will not debar them from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peaceful enjoyment of those possessions which they have acquired.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XV: That Religious Belief Sometimes Turns The Thoughts Of The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans To Immaterial Pleasures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the United States, on the seventh day of every week, the trading and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,working life of the nation seems suspended; all noises cease; a deep,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tranquillity, say rather the solemn calm of meditation, succeeds the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"turmoil of the week, and the soul resumes possession and contemplation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of itself. Upon this day the marts of traffic are deserted; every member,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community, accompanied by his children, goes to church, where he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,listens to strange language which would seem unsuited to his ear. He,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is told of the countless evils caused by pride and covetousness: he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is reminded of the necessity of checking his desires, of the finer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasures which belong to virtue alone, and of the true happiness which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attends it. On his return home, he does not turn to the ledgers of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"calling, but he opens the book of Holy Scripture; there he meets with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sublime or affecting descriptions of the greatness and goodness of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Creator, of the infinite magnificence of the handiwork of God, of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lofty destinies of man, of his duties, and of his immortal privileges.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus it is that the American at times steals an hour from himself; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"laying aside for a while the petty passions which agitate his life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the ephemeral interests which engross it, he strays at once into an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideal world, where all is great, eternal, and pure.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have endeavored to point out in another part of this work the causes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to which the maintenance of the political institutions of the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is attributable; and religion appeared to be one of the most prominent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst them. I am now treating of the Americans in an individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"capacity, and I again observe that religion is not less useful to each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizen than to the whole State. The Americans show, by their practice,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they feel the high necessity of imparting morality to democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,communities by means of religion. What they think of themselves in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this respect is a truth of which every democratic nation ought to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thoroughly persuaded.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not doubt that the social and political constitution of a people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"predisposes them to adopt a certain belief and certain tastes, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,afterwards flourish without difficulty amongst them; whilst the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"causes may divert a people from certain opinions and propensities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without any voluntary effort, and, as it were, without any distinct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consciousness, on their part. The whole art of the legislator","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is correctly to discern beforehand these natural inclinations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communities of men, in order to know whether they should be assisted, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whether it may not be necessary to check them. For the duties incumbent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on the legislator differ at different times; the goal towards which the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,human race ought ever to be tending is alone stationary; the means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reaching it are perpetually to be varied.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If I had been born in an aristocratic age, in the midst of a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"where the hereditary wealth of some, and the irremediable penury of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others, should equally divert men from the idea of bettering their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition, and hold the soul as it were in a state of torpor fixed on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contemplation of another world, I should then wish that it were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possible for me to rouse that people to a sense of their wants; I should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seek to discover more rapid and more easy means for satisfying the fresh,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires which I might have awakened; and, directing the most strenuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"efforts of the human mind to physical pursuits, I should endeavor to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stimulate it to promote the well-being of man. If it happened that some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men were immoderately incited to the pursuit of riches, and displayed an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"excessive liking for physical gratifications, I should not be alarmed;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these peculiar symptoms would soon be absorbed in the general aspect of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The attention of the legislators of democracies is called to other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cares. Give democratic nations education and freedom, and leave them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,alone. They will soon learn to draw from this world all the benefits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which it can afford; they will improve each of the useful arts, and will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day by day render life more comfortable, more convenient, and more easy.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Their social condition naturally urges them in this direction; I do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fear that they will slacken their course.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But whilst man takes delight in this honest and lawful pursuit of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wellbeing, it is to be apprehended that he may in the end lose the use","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his sublimest faculties; and that whilst he is busied in improving,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all around him, he may at length degrade himself. Here, and here only,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does the peril lie. It should therefore be the unceasing object of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislators of democracies, and of all the virtuous and enlightened men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who live there, to raise the souls of their fellow-citizens, and keep","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them lifted up towards heaven. It is necessary that all who feel an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interest in the future destinies of democratic society should unite, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that all should make joint and continual efforts to diffuse the love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the infinite, a sense of greatness, and a love of pleasures not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of earth. If amongst the opinions of a democratic people any of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pernicious theories exist which tend to inculcate that all perishes with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the body, let men by whom such theories are professed be marked as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural foes of such a people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The materialists are offensive to me in many respects; their doctrines,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I hold to be pernicious, and I am disgusted at their arrogance. If their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"system could be of any utility to man, it would seem to be by giving him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a modest opinion of himself. But these reasoners show that it is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,so; and when they think they have said enough to establish that they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brutes, they show themselves as proud as if they had demonstrated that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are gods. Materialism is, amongst all nations, a dangerous disease","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the human mind; but it is more especially to be dreaded amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people, because it readily amalgamates with that vice which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is most familiar to the heart under such circumstances. Democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"encourages a taste for physical gratification: this taste, if it become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"excessive, soon disposes men to believe that all is matter only; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"materialism, in turn, hurries them back with mad impatience to these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same delights: such is the fatal circle within which democratic nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are driven round. It were well that they should see the danger and hold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,back.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Most religions are only general, simple, and practical means of teaching","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. That is the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"benefit which a democratic people derives, from its belief, and hence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belief is more necessary to such a people than to all others. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore any religion has struck its roots deep into a democracy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beware lest you disturb them; but rather watch it carefully, as the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,precious bequest of aristocratic ages. Seek not to supersede the old,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religious opinions of men by new ones; lest in the passage from one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"faith to another, the soul being left for a while stripped of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief, the love of physical gratifications should grow upon it and fill","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it wholly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The doctrine of metempsychosis is assuredly not more rational than that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of materialism; nevertheless if it were absolutely necessary that a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy should choose one of the two, I should not hesitate to decide","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the community would run less risk of being brutalized by believing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the soul of man will pass into the carcass of a hog, than by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,believing that the soul of man is nothing at all. The belief in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supersensual and immortal principle, united for a time to matter, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so indispensable to man's greatness, that its effects are striking even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,when it is not united to the doctrine of future reward and punishment;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and when it holds no more than that after death the divine principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contained in man is absorbed in the Deity, or transferred to animate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the frame of some other creature. Men holding so imperfect a belief will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,still consider the body as the secondary and inferior portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their nature, and they will despise it even whilst they yield to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,influence; whereas they have a natural esteem and secret admiration for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the immaterial part of man, even though they sometimes refuse to submit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to its dominion. That is enough to give a lofty cast to their opinions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and their tastes, and to bid them tend with no interested motive, and as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it were by impulse, to pure feelings and elevated thoughts.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is not certain that Socrates and his followers had very fixed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions as to what would befall man hereafter; but the sole point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of belief on which they were determined--that the soul has nothing in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common with the body, and survives it--was enough to give the Platonic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,philosophy that sublime aspiration by which it is distinguished. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is clear from the works of Plato, that many philosophical writers, his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"predecessors or contemporaries, professed materialism. These writers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have not reached us, or have reached us in mere fragments. The same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thing has happened in almost all ages; the greater part of the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,famous minds in literature adhere to the doctrines of a supersensual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,philosophy. The instinct and the taste of the human race maintain those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"doctrines; they save them oftentimes in spite of men themselves, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,raise the names of their defenders above the tide of time. It must not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then be supposed that at any period or under any political condition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the passion for physical gratifications, and the opinions which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superinduced by that passion, can ever content a whole people. The heart","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of man is of a larger mould: it can at once comprise a taste for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possessions of earth and the love of those of heaven: at times it may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seem to cling devotedly to the one, but it will never be long without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thinking of the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If it be easy to see that it is more particularly important in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages that spiritual opinions should prevail, it is not easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to say by what means those who govern democratic nations may make them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"predominate. I am no believer in the prosperity, any more than in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"durability, of official philosophies; and as to state religions, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have always held, that if they be sometimes of momentary service to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interests of political power, they always, sooner or later, become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fatal to the Church. Nor do I think with those who assert, that to raise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"religion in the eyes of the people, and to make them do honor to her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spiritual doctrines, it is desirable indirectly to give her ministers a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political influence which the laws deny them. I am so much alive to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the almost inevitable dangers which beset religious belief whenever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the clergy take part in public affairs, and I am so convinced that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Christianity must be maintained at any cost in the bosom of modern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies, that I had rather shut up the priesthood within the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sanctuary than allow them to step beyond it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What means then remain in the hands of constituted authorities to bring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men back to spiritual opinions, or to hold them fast to the religion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by which those opinions are suggested? My answer will do me harm in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the eyes of politicians. I believe that the sole effectual means which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,governments can employ in order to have the doctrine of the immortality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the soul duly respected, is ever to act as if they believed in it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves; and I think that it is only by scrupulous conformity to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religious morality in great affairs that they can hope to teach the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community at large to know, to love, and to observe it in the lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concerns of life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Welfare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is a closer tie than is commonly supposed between the improvement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the soul and the amelioration of what belongs to the body. Man may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leave these two things apart, and consider each of them alternately; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he cannot sever them entirely without at last losing sight of one and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other. The beasts have the same senses as ourselves, and very nearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same appetites. We have no sensual passions which are not common,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to our race and theirs, and which are not to be found, at least in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"germ, in a dog as well as in a man. Whence is it then that the animals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can only provide for their first and lowest wants, whereas we can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infinitely vary and endlessly increase our enjoyments?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We are superior to the beasts in this, that we use our souls to find out","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those material benefits to which they are only led by instinct. In man,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the angel teaches the brute the art of contenting its desires. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"because man is capable of rising above the things of the body, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemning life itself, of which the beasts have not the least notion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that he can multiply these same things of the body to a degree which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inferior races are equally unable to conceive. Whatever elevates,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enlarges, and expands the soul, renders it more capable of succeeding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in those very undertakings which concern it not. Whatever, on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand, enervates or lowers it, weakens it for all purposes, the chiefest,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as well as the least, and threatens to render it almost equally impotent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for the one and for the other. Hence the soul must remain great and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strong, though it were only to devote its strength and greatness from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time to time to the service of the body. If men were ever to content,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves with material objects, it is probable that they would lose by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"degrees the art of producing them; and they would enjoy them in the end,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"like the brutes, without discernment and without improvement.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"Sceptical Opinions, It Is Important To Remove To A Distance The Objects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Of Human Actions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the ages of faith the final end of life is placed beyond life. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men of those ages therefore naturally, and in a manner involuntarily,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accustom themselves to fix their gaze for a long course of years on some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immovable object, towards which they are constantly tending; and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,learn by insensible degrees to repress a multitude of petty passing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires, in order to be the better able to content that great and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lasting desire which possesses them. When these same men engage in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affairs of this world, the same habits may be traced in their conduct.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,They are apt to set up some general and certain aim and end to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"actions here below, towards which all their efforts are directed: they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not turn from day to day to chase some novel object of desire, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they have settled designs which they are never weary of pursuing. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,explains why religious nations have so often achieved such lasting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"results: for whilst they were thinking only of the other world, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had found out the great secret of success in this. Religions give men a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general habit of conducting themselves with a view to futurity: in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this respect they are not less useful to happiness in this life than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to felicity hereafter; and this is one of their chief political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,characteristics.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But in proportion as the light of faith grows dim, the range of man's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sight is circumscribed, as if the end and aim of human actions appeared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every day to be more within his reach. When men have once allowed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves to think no more of what is to befall them after life, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"readily lapse into that complete and brutal indifference to futurity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which is but too conformable to some propensities of mankind. As soon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as they have lost the habit of placing their chief hopes upon remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"events, they naturally seek to gratify without delay their smallest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires; and no sooner do they despair of living forever, than they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are disposed to act as if they were to exist but for a single day.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In sceptical ages it is always therefore to be feared that men may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually give way to their daily casual desires; and that, wholly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"renouncing whatever cannot be acquired without protracted effort, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may establish nothing great, permanent, and calm.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If the social condition of a people, under these circumstances, becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic, the danger which I here point out is thereby increased. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everyone is constantly striving to change his position--when an immense,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,field for competition is thrown open to all--when wealth is amassed or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dissipated in the shortest possible space of time amidst the turmoil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of democracy, visions of sudden and easy fortunes--of great possessions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"easily won and lost--of chance, under all its forms--haunt the mind. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,instability of society itself fosters the natural instability of man's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires. In the midst of these perpetual fluctuations of his lot, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"present grows upon his mind, until it conceals futurity from his sight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and his looks go no further than the morrow.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In those countries in which unhappily irreligion and democracy coexist,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the most important duty of philosophers and of those in power is to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always striving to place the objects of human actions far beyond man's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,immediate range. Circumscribed by the character of his country and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his age, the moralist must learn to vindicate his principles in that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position. He must constantly endeavor to show his contemporaries, that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"even in the midst of the perpetual commotion around them, it is easier","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than they think to conceive and to execute protracted undertakings. He,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must teach them that, although the aspect of mankind may have changed,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the methods by which men may provide for their prosperity in this world,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are still the same; and that amongst democratic nations, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elsewhere, it is only by resisting a thousand petty selfish passions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the hour that the general and unquenchable passion for happiness can be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,satisfied.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The task of those in power is not less clearly marked out. At all times,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is important that those who govern nations should act with a view to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the future: but this is even more necessary in democratic and sceptical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ages than in any others. By acting thus, the leading men of democracies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not only make public affairs prosperous, but they also teach private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individuals, by their example, the art of managing private concerns.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Above all they must strive as much as possible to banish chance from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sphere of politics. The sudden and undeserved promotion of a courtier,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"produces only a transient impression in an aristocratic country, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the aggregate institutions and opinions of the nation habitually compel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men to advance slowly in tracks which they cannot get out of. But,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing is more pernicious than similar instances of favor exhibited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the eyes of a democratic people: they give the last impulse to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public mind in a direction where everything hurries it onwards. At times,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of scepticism and equality more especially, the favor of the people or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the prince, which chance may confer or chance withhold, ought never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to stand in lieu of attainments or services. It is desirable that every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advancement should there appear to be the result of some effort; so that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no greatness should be of too easy acquirement, and that ambition should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be obliged to fix its gaze long upon an object before it is gratified.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Governments must apply themselves to restore to men that love of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,future with which religion and the state of society no longer inspire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them; and, without saying so, they must practically teach the community","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day by day that wealth, fame, and power are the rewards of labor--that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great success stands at the utmost range of long desires, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing lasting is obtained but what is obtained by toil. When men have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accustomed themselves to foresee from afar what is likely to befall in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world and to feed upon hopes, they can hardly confine their minds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"within the precise circumference of life, and they are ready to break","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the boundary and cast their looks beyond. I do not doubt that, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,training the members of a community to think of their future condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in this world, they would be gradually and unconsciously brought nearer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to religious convictions. Thus the means which allow men, up to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain point, to go without religion, are perhaps after all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only means we still possess for bringing mankind back by a long and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,roundabout path to a state of faith.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVIII: That Amongst The Americans All Honest Callings Are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Honorable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst a democratic people, where there is no hereditary wealth, every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man works to earn a living, or has worked, or is born of parents who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have worked. The notion of labor is therefore presented to the mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on every side as the necessary, natural, and honest condition of human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"existence. Not only is labor not dishonorable amongst such a people, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it is held in honor: the prejudice is not against it, but in its favor.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States a wealthy man thinks that he owes it to public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion to devote his leisure to some kind of industrial or commercial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuit, or to public business. He would think himself in bad repute if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he employed his life solely in living. It is for the purpose of escaping,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this obligation to work, that so many rich Americans come to Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"where they find some scattered remains of aristocratic society, amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which idleness is still held in honor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Equality of conditions not only ennobles the notion of labor in men's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"estimation, but it raises the notion of labor as a source of profit. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracies it is not exactly labor that is despised, but labor with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a view to profit. Labor is honorific in itself, when it is undertaken at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sole bidding of ambition or of virtue. Yet in aristocratic society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it constantly happens that he who works for honor is not insensible to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the attractions of profit. But these two desires only intermingle in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the innermost depths of his soul: he carefully hides from every eye,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the point at which they join; he would fain conceal it from himself. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic countries there are few public officers who do not affect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to serve their country without interested motives. Their salary is an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"incident of which they think but little, and of which they always affect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not to think at all. Thus the notion of profit is kept distinct from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that of labor; however they may be united in point of fact, they are not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thought of together.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic communities these two notions are, on the contrary, always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,palpably united. As the desire of well-being is universal--as fortunes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are slender or fluctuating--as everyone wants either to increase his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own resources, or to provide fresh ones for his progeny, men clearly see","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that it is profit which, if not wholly, at least partially, leads them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to work. Even those who are principally actuated by the love of fame are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessarily made familiar with the thought that they are not exclusively,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,actuated by that motive; and they discover that the desire of getting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a living is mingled in their minds with the desire of making life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,illustrious.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"As soon as, on the one hand, labor is held by the whole community to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an honorable necessity of man's condition, and, on the other, as soon as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"labor is always ostensibly performed, wholly or in part, for the purpose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of earning remuneration, the immense interval which separated different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"callings in aristocratic societies disappears. If all are not alike, all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at least have one feature in common. No profession exists in which men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do not work for money; and the remuneration which is common to them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all gives them all an air of resemblance. This serves to explain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the opinions which the Americans entertain with respect to different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"callings. In America no one is degraded because he works, for everyone","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,about him works also; nor is anyone humiliated by the notion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"receiving pay, for the President of the United States also works for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pay. He is paid for commanding, other men for obeying orders. In the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States professions are more or less laborious, more or less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,profitable; but they are never either high or low: every honest calling,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is honorable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIX: That Almost All The Americans Follow Industrial Callings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Agriculture is, perhaps, of all the useful arts that which improves most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"slowly amongst democratic nations. Frequently, indeed, it would seem","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be stationary, because other arts are making rapid strides towards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perfection. On the other hand, almost all the tastes and habits which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the equality of condition engenders naturally lead men to commercial and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,industrial occupations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Suppose an active, enlightened, and free man, enjoying a competency, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,full of desires: he is too poor to live in idleness; he is rich enough,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to feel himself protected from the immediate fear of want, and he thinks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,how he can better his condition. This man has conceived a taste for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"physical gratifications, which thousands of his fellow-men indulge in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"around him; he has himself begun to enjoy these pleasures, and he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,eager to increase his means of satisfying these tastes more completely.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But life is slipping away, time is urgent--to what is he to turn? The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cultivation of the ground promises an almost certain result to his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exertions, but a slow one; men are not enriched by it without patience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and toil. Agriculture is therefore only suited to those who have already,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"large, superfluous wealth, or to those whose penury bids them only seek","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a bare subsistence. The choice of such a man as we have supposed is soon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"made; he sells his plot of ground, leaves his dwelling, and embarks in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,some hazardous but lucrative calling. Democratic communities abound,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in men of this kind; and in proportion as the equality of conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"becomes greater, their multitude increases. Thus democracy not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"swells the number of workingmen, but it leads men to prefer one kind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of labor to another; and whilst it diverts them from agriculture, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,encourages their taste for commerce and manufactures. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: It has often been remarked that manufacturers and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mercantile men are inordinately addicted to physical gratifications, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this has been attributed to commerce and manufactures; but that is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I apprehend, to take the effect for the cause. The taste for physical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gratifications is not imparted to men by commerce or manufactures,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it is rather this taste which leads men to embark in commerce and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufactures, as a means by which they hope to satisfy themselves more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,promptly and more completely. If commerce and manufactures increase the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desire of well-being, it is because every passion gathers strength in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proportion as it is cultivated, and is increased by all the efforts made","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to satiate it. All the causes which make the love of worldly welfare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,predominate in the heart of man are favorable to the growth of commerce,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and manufactures. Equality of conditions is one of those causes; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"encourages trade, not directly by giving men a taste for business, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indirectly by strengthening and expanding in their minds a taste for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prosperity.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This spirit may be observed even amongst the richest members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community. In democratic countries, however opulent a man is supposed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be, he is almost always discontented with his fortune, because he finds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that he is less rich than his father was, and he fears that his sons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be less rich than himself. Most rich men in democracies are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore constantly haunted by the desire of obtaining wealth, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally turn their attention to trade and manufactures, which appear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to offer the readiest and most powerful means of success. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect they share the instincts of the poor, without feeling the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same necessities; say rather, they feel the most imperious of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessities, that of not sinking in the world.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In aristocracies the rich are at the same time those who govern. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attention which they unceasingly devote to important public affairs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,diverts them from the lesser cares which trade and manufactures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"demand. If the will of an individual happens, nevertheless, to turn his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attention to business, the will of the body to which he belongs will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,immediately debar him from pursuing it; for however men may declaim,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"against the rule of numbers, they cannot wholly escape their sway; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,even amongst those aristocratic bodies which most obstinately refuse to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acknowledge the rights of the majority of the nation, a private majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is formed which governs the rest. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote b: Some aristocracies, however, have devoted themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eagerly to commerce, and have cultivated manufactures with success. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"history of the world might furnish several conspicuous examples. But,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"generally speaking, it may be affirmed that the aristocratic principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is not favorable to the growth of trade and manufactures. Moneyed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracies are the only exception to the rule. Amongst such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracies there are hardly any desires which do not require wealth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to satisfy them; the love of riches becomes, so to speak, the high road","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of human passions, which is crossed by or connected with all lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tracks. The love of money and the thirst for that distinction which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attaches to power, are then so closely intermixed in the same souls,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that it becomes difficult to discover whether men grow covetous from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ambition, or whether they are ambitious from covetousness. This is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the case in England, where men seek to get rich in order to arrive at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distinction, and seek distinctions as a manifestation of their wealth.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The mind is then seized by both ends, and hurried into trade and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufactures, which are the shortest roads that lead to opulence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This, however, strikes me as an exceptional and transitory circumstance.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When wealth is become the only symbol of aristocracy, it is very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficult for the wealthy to maintain sole possession of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power, to the exclusion of all other men. The aristocracy of birth and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pure democracy are at the two extremes of the social and political state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of nations: between them moneyed aristocracy finds its place. The latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,approximates to the aristocracy of birth by conferring great privileges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on a small number of persons; it so far belongs to the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"element, that these privileges may be successively acquired by all. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently forms a natural transition between these two conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of society, and it is difficult to say whether it closes the reign of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic institutions, or whether it already opens the new era of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracy.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic countries, where money does not lead those who possess it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to political power, but often removes them from it, the rich do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,know how to spend their leisure. They are driven into active life by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inquietude and the greatness of their desires, by the extent of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resources, and by the taste for what is extraordinary, which is almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always felt by those who rise, by whatsoever means, above the crowd.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Trade is the only road open to them. In democracies nothing is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great or more brilliant than commerce: it attracts the attention of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the public, and fills the imagination of the multitude; all energetic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions are directed towards it. Neither their own prejudices, nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those of anybody else, can prevent the rich from devoting themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to it. The wealthy members of democracies never form a body which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manners and regulations of its own; the opinions peculiar to their class,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not restrain them, and the common opinions of their country urge them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on. Moreover, as all the large fortunes which are to be met with in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic community are of commercial growth, many generations must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,succeed each other before their possessors can have entirely laid aside,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their habits of business.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Circumscribed within the narrow space which politics leave them, rich","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men in democracies eagerly embark in commercial enterprise: there they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can extend and employ their natural advantages; and indeed it is even by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the boldness and the magnitude of their industrial speculations that we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may measure the slight esteem in which productive industry would have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been held by them, if they had been born amidst an aristocracy.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A similar observation is likewise applicable to all men living in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies, whether they be poor or rich. Those who live in the midst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democratic fluctuations have always before their eyes the phantom of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,chance; and they end by liking all undertakings in which chance plays a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part. They are therefore all led to engage in commerce, not only for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the sake of the profit it holds out to them, but for the love of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constant excitement occasioned by that pursuit.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The United States of America have only been emancipated for half a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,century [in 1840] from the state of colonial dependence in which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stood to Great Britain; the number of large fortunes there is small, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,capital is still scarce. Yet no people in the world has made such rapid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,progress in trade and manufactures as the Americans: they constitute at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the present day the second maritime nation in the world; and although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their manufactures have to struggle with almost insurmountable natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impediments, they are not prevented from making great and daily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advances. In the United States the greatest undertakings and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speculations are executed without difficulty, because the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"population is engaged in productive industry, and because the poorest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as well as the most opulent members of the commonwealth are ready to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"combine their efforts for these purposes. The consequence is, that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stranger is constantly amazed by the immense public works executed by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation which contains, so to speak, no rich men. The Americans arrived","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but as yesterday on the territory which they inhabit, and they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,already changed the whole order of nature for their own advantage. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have joined the Hudson to the Mississippi, and made the Atlantic Ocean","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communicate with the Gulf of Mexico, across a continent of more than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,five hundred leagues in extent which separates the two seas. The longest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,railroads which have been constructed up to the present time are in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America. But what most astonishes me in the United States, is not so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much the marvellous grandeur of some undertakings, as the innumerable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,multitude of small ones. Almost all the farmers of the United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,combine some trade with agriculture; most of them make agriculture,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself a trade. It seldom happens that an American farmer settles for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,good upon the land which he occupies: especially in the districts of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Far West he brings land into tillage in order to sell it again, and not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to farm it: he builds a farmhouse on the speculation that, as the state","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the country will soon be changed by the increase of population, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,good price will be gotten for it. Every year a swarm of the inhabitants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the North arrive in the Southern States, and settle in the parts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,where the cotton plant and the sugar-cane grow. These men cultivate the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,soil in order to make it produce in a few years enough to enrich them;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they already look forward to the time when they may return home,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to enjoy the competency thus acquired. Thus the Americans carry their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,business-like qualities into agriculture; and their trading passions are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,displayed in that as in their other pursuits.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The Americans make immense progress in productive industry, because they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all devote themselves to it at once; and for this same reason they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exposed to very unexpected and formidable embarrassments. As they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all engaged in commerce, their commercial affairs are affected by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such various and complex causes that it is impossible to foresee,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what difficulties may arise. As they are all more or less engaged in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"productive industry, at the least shock given to business all private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortunes are put in jeopardy at the same time, and the State is shaken.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe that the return of these commercial panics is an endemic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disease of the democratic nations of our age. It may be rendered less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangerous, but it cannot be cured; because it does not originate in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accidental circumstances, but in the temperament of these nations.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XX: That Aristocracy May Be Engendered By Manufactures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have shown that democracy is favorable to the growth of manufactures,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and that it increases without limit the numbers of the manufacturing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,classes: we shall now see by what side road manufacturers may possibly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in their turn bring men back to aristocracy. It is acknowledged that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when a workman is engaged every day upon the same detail, the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commodity is produced with greater ease, promptitude, and economy. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is likewise acknowledged that the cost of the production of manufactured,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,goods is diminished by the extent of the establishment in which they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"made, and by the amount of capital employed or of credit. These truths","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had long been imperfectly discerned, but in our time they have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demonstrated. They have been already applied to many very important,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kinds of manufactures, and the humblest will gradually be governed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. I know of nothing in politics which deserves to fix the attention,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the legislator more closely than these two new axioms of the science,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of manufactures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When a workman is unceasingly and exclusively engaged in the fabrication,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of one thing, he ultimately does his work with singular dexterity; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at the same time he loses the general faculty of applying his mind to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the direction of the work. He every day becomes more adroit and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industrious; so that it may be said of him, that in proportion as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,workman improves the man is degraded. What can be expected of a man who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has spent twenty years of his life in making heads for pins? and to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"what can that mighty human intelligence, which has so often stirred the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world, be applied in him, except it be to investigate the best method of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,making pins' heads? When a workman has spent a considerable portion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his existence in this manner, his thoughts are forever set upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of his daily toil; his body has contracted certain fixed habits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which it can never shake off: in a word, he no longer belongs to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself, but to the calling which he has chosen. It is in vain that laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and manners have been at the pains to level all barriers round such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a man, and to open to him on every side a thousand different paths to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fortune; a theory of manufactures more powerful than manners and laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"binds him to a craft, and frequently to a spot, which he cannot leave:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it assigns to him a certain place in society, beyond which he cannot go:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the midst of universal movement it has rendered him stationary.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In proportion as the principle of the division of labor is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extensively applied, the workman becomes more weak, more narrow-minded,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and more dependent. The art advances, the artisan recedes. On the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand, in proportion as it becomes more manifest that the productions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures are by so much the cheaper and better as the manufacture is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"larger and the amount of capital employed more considerable, wealthy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and educated men come forward to embark in manufactures which were,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,heretofore abandoned to poor or ignorant handicraftsmen. The magnitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the efforts required, and the importance of the results to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obtained, attract them. Thus at the very time at which the science","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of manufactures lowers the class of workmen, it raises the class of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,masters.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Whereas the workman concentrates his faculties more and more upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"study of a single detail, the master surveys a more extensive whole, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the mind of the latter is enlarged in proportion as that of the former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is narrowed. In a short time the one will require nothing but physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength without intelligence; the other stands in need of science, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost of genius, to insure success. This man resembles more and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the administrator of a vast empire--that man, a brute. The master and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the workman have then here no similarity, and their differences increase","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every day. They are only connected as the two rings at the extremities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a long chain. Each of them fills the station which is made for him,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and out of which he does not get: the one is continually, closely, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessarily dependent upon the other, and seems as much born to obey as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that other is to command. What is this but aristocracy?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As the conditions of men constituting the nation become more and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, the demand for manufactured commodities becomes more general and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more extensive; and the cheapness which places these objects within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the reach of slender fortunes becomes a great element of success. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there are every day more men of great opulence and education who devote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their wealth and knowledge to manufactures; and who seek, by opening","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"large establishments, and by a strict division of labor, to meet the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fresh demands which are made on all sides. Thus, in proportion as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mass of the nation turns to democracy, that particular class which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engaged in manufactures becomes more aristocratic. Men grow more alike,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the one--more different in the other; and inequality increases in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the less numerous class in the same ratio in which it decreases in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the community. Hence it would appear, on searching to the bottom, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracy should naturally spring out of the bosom of democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But this kind of aristocracy by no means resembles those kinds which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"preceded it. It will be observed at once, that as it applies exclusively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to manufactures and to some manufacturing callings, it is a monstrous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exception in the general aspect of society. The small aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,societies which are formed by some manufacturers in the midst of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immense democracy of our age, contain, like the great aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"societies of former ages, some men who are very opulent, and a multitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who are wretchedly poor. The poor have few means of escaping from their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition and becoming rich; but the rich are constantly becoming poor,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or they give up business when they have realized a fortune. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,elements of which the class of the poor is composed are fixed; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,elements of which the class of the rich is composed are not so. To say,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the truth, though there are rich men, the class of rich men does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exist; for these rich individuals have no feelings or purposes in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common, no mutual traditions or mutual hopes; there are therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members, but no body.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Not only are the rich not compactly united amongst themselves, but there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is no real bond between them and the poor. Their relative position is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not a permanent one; they are constantly drawn together or separated by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their interests. The workman is generally dependent on the master, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not on any particular master; these two men meet in the factory, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,know not each other elsewhere; and whilst they come into contact on one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"point, they stand very wide apart on all others. The manufacturer asks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing of the workman but his labor; the workman expects nothing from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him but his wages. The one contracts no obligation to protect, nor the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other to defend; and they are not permanently connected either by habit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or by duty. The aristocracy created by business rarely settles in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,midst of the manufacturing population which it directs; the object,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not to govern that population, but to use it. An aristocracy thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constituted can have no great hold upon those whom it employs; and even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"if it succeed in retaining them at one moment, they escape the next; it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knows not how to will, and it cannot act. The territorial aristocracy of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"former ages was either bound by law, or thought itself bound by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"usage, to come to the relief of its serving-men, and to succor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their distresses. But the manufacturing aristocracy of our age first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impoverishes and debases the men who serve it, and then abandons them to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be supported by the charity of the public. This is a natural consequence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of what has been said before. Between the workmen and the master there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are frequent relations, but no real partnership.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the manufacturing aristocracy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which is growing up under our eyes is one of the harshest which ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,existed in the world; but at the same time it is one of the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confined and least dangerous. Nevertheless the friends of democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should keep their eyes anxiously fixed in this direction; for if ever a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permanent inequality of conditions and aristocracy again penetrate into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world, it may be predicted that this is the channel by which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will enter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter I: That Manners Are Softened As Social Conditions Become More,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,We perceive that for several ages social conditions have tended to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, and we discover that in the course of the same period the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manners of society have been softened. Are these two things merely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemporaneous, or does any secret link exist between them, so that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,one cannot go on without making the other advance? Several causes may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concur to render the manners of a people less rude; but, of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these causes, the most powerful appears to me to be the equality of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions. Equality of conditions and growing civility in manners are,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then, in my eyes, not only contemporaneous occurrences, but correlative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"facts. When the fabulists seek to interest us in the actions of beasts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they invest them with human notions and passions; the poets who sing of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirits and angels do the same; there is no wretchedness so deep, nor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"any happiness so pure, as to fill the human mind and touch the heart,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unless we are ourselves held up to our own eyes under other features.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This is strictly applicable to the subject upon which we are at present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engaged. When all men are irrevocably marshalled in an aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, according to their professions, their property, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"birth, the members of each class, considering themselves as children","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the same family, cherish a constant and lively sympathy towards each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, which can never be felt in an equal degree by the citizens of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a democracy. But the same feeling does not exist between the several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,classes towards each other. Amongst an aristocratic people each caste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has its own opinions, feelings, rights, manners, and modes of living.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus the men of whom each caste is composed do not resemble the mass of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their fellow-citizens; they do not think or feel in the same manner,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they scarcely believe that they belong to the same human race. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot, therefore, thoroughly understand what others feel, nor judge of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,others by themselves. Yet they are sometimes eager to lend each other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mutual aid; but this is not contrary to my previous observation. These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic institutions, which made the beings of one and the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"race so different, nevertheless bound them to each other by close","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political ties. Although the serf had no natural interest in the fate of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nobles, he did not the less think himself obliged to devote his person","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the service of that noble who happened to be his lord; and although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the noble held himself to be of a different nature from that of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"serfs, he nevertheless held that his duty and his honor constrained","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him to defend, at the risk of his own life, those who dwelt upon his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,domains.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is evident that these mutual obligations did not originate in the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of nature, but in the law of society; and that the claim of social duty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was more stringent than that of mere humanity. These services were not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supposed to be due from man to man, but to the vassal or to the lord.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Feudal institutions awakened a lively sympathy for the sufferings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain men, but none at all for the miseries of mankind. They infused","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"generosity rather than mildness into the manners of the time, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"although they prompted men to great acts of self-devotion, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engendered no real sympathies; for real sympathies can only exist,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between those who are alike; and in aristocratic ages men acknowledge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,none but the members of their own caste to be like themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the chroniclers of the Middle Ages, who all belonged to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy by birth or education, relate the tragical end of a noble,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their grief flows apace; whereas they tell you at a breath, and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wincing, of massacres and tortures inflicted on the common sort of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people. Not that these writers felt habitual hatred or systematic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disdain for the people; war between the several classes of the community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was not yet declared. They were impelled by an instinct rather than by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passion; as they had formed no clear notion of a poor man's sufferings,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they cared but little for his fate. The same feelings animated the lower,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,orders whenever the feudal tie was broken. The same ages which witnessed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,so many heroic acts of self-devotion on the part of vassals for their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lords, were stained with atrocious barbarities, exercised from time to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time by the lower classes on the higher. It must not be supposed that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this mutual insensibility arose solely from the absence of public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order and education; for traces of it are to be found in the following,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centuries, which became tranquil and enlightened whilst they remained","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic. In 1675 the lower classes in Brittany revolted at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the imposition of a new tax. These disturbances were put down with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unexampled atrocity. Observe the language in which Madame de Sevigne, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"witness of these horrors, relates them to her daughter:--","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"It would be a mistake to suppose that Madame de Sevigne, who wrote these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lines, was a selfish or cruel person; she was passionately attached","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to her children, and very ready to sympathize in the sorrows of her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"friends; nay, her letters show that she treated her vassals and servants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with kindness and indulgence. But Madame de Sevigne had no clear notion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of suffering in anyone who was not a person of quality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In our time the harshest man writing to the most insensible person of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his acquaintance would not venture wantonly to indulge in the cruel,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,jocularity which I have quoted; and even if his own manners allowed him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to do so, the manners of society at large would forbid it. Whence does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this arise? Have we more sensibility than our forefathers? I know not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that we have; but I am sure that our insensibility is extended to a far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greater range of objects. When all the ranks of a community are nearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, as all men think and feel in nearly the same manner, each of them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may judge in a moment of the sensations of all the others; he casts a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rapid glance upon himself, and that is enough. There is no wretchedness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into which he cannot readily enter, and a secret instinct reveals to him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its extent. It signifies not that strangers or foes be the sufferers;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imagination puts him in their place; something like a personal feeling,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is mingled with his pity, and makes himself suffer whilst the body","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his fellow-creature is in torture. In democratic ages men rarely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sacrifice themselves for one another; but they display general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compassion for the members of the human race. They inflict no useless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ills; and they are happy to relieve the griefs of others, when they can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do so without much hurting themselves; they are not disinterested, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are humane.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Although the Americans have, in a manner, reduced egotism to a social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and philosophical theory, they are nevertheless extremely open to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compassion. In no country is criminal justice administered with more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mildness than in the United States. Whilst the English seem disposed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,carefully to retain the bloody traces of the dark ages in their penal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislation, the Americans have almost expunged capital punishment from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their codes. North America is, I think, the only one country upon earth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in which the life of no one citizen has been taken for a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,offence in the course of the last fifty years. The circumstance which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conclusively shows that this singular mildness of the Americans arises,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chiefly from their social condition, is the manner in which they treat","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their slaves. Perhaps there is not, upon the whole, a single European","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,colony in the New World in which the physical condition of the blacks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is less severe than in the United States; yet the slaves still endure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"horrid sufferings there, and are constantly exposed to barbarous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,punishments. It is easy to perceive that the lot of these unhappy beings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inspires their masters with but little compassion, and that they look","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon slavery, not only as an institution which is profitable to them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but as an evil which does not affect them. Thus the same man who is full,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of humanity towards his fellow-creatures when they are at the same time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his equals, becomes insensible to their afflictions as soon as that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality ceases. His mildness should therefore be attributed to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality of conditions, rather than to civilization and education.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"What I have here remarked of individuals is, to a certain extent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applicable to nations. When each nation has its distinct opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belief, laws, and customs, it looks upon itself as the whole of mankind,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and is moved by no sorrows but its own. Should war break out between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"two nations animated by this feeling, it is sure to be waged with great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cruelty. At the time of their highest culture, the Romans slaughtered","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the generals of their enemies, after having dragged them in triumph","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,behind a car; and they flung their prisoners to the beasts of the Circus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for the amusement of the people. Cicero, who declaimed so vehemently at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the notion of crucifying a Roman citizen, had not a word to say against","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these horrible abuses of victory. It is evident that in his eyes a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,barbarian did not belong to the same human race as a Roman. On the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, in proportion as nations become more like each other, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become reciprocally more compassionate, and the law of nations is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mitigated.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter II: That Democracy Renders The Habitual Intercourse Of The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans Simple And Easy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democracy does not attach men strongly to each other; but it places,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their habitual intercourse upon an easier footing. If two Englishmen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chance to meet at the Antipodes, where they are surrounded by strangers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whose language and manners are almost unknown to them, they will first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stare at each other with much curiosity and a kind of secret uneasiness;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they will then turn away, or, if one accosts the other, they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take care only to converse with a constrained and absent air upon very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unimportant subjects. Yet there is no enmity between these men; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have never seen each other before, and each believes the other to be a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,respectable person. Why then should they stand so cautiously apart? We,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must go back to England to learn the reason.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When it is birth alone, independent of wealth, which classes men in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society, everyone knows exactly what his own position is upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"social scale; he does not seek to rise, he does not fear to sink. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a community thus organized, men of different castes communicate very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"little with each other; but if accident brings them together, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ready to converse without hoping or fearing to lose their own position.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Their intercourse is not upon a footing of equality, but it is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constrained. When moneyed aristocracy succeeds to aristocracy of birth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the case is altered. The privileges of some are still extremely great,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but the possibility of acquiring those privileges is open to all: whence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it follows that those who possess them are constantly haunted by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"apprehension of losing them, or of other men's sharing them; those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not yet enjoy them long to possess them at any cost, or, if they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fail to appear at least to possess them--which is not impossible. As the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,social importance of men is no longer ostensibly and permanently fixed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by blood, and is infinitely varied by wealth, ranks still exist, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is not easy clearly to distinguish at a glance those who respectively,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belong to them. Secret hostilities then arise in the community; one set,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of men endeavor by innumerable artifices to penetrate, or to appear to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"penetrate, amongst those who are above them; another set are constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in arms against these usurpers of their rights; or rather the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual does both at once, and whilst he seeks to raise himself into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a higher circle, he is always on the defensive against the intrusion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those below him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Such is the condition of England at the present time; and I am of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion that the peculiarity before adverted to is principally to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attributed to this cause. As aristocratic pride is still extremely great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst the English, and as the limits of aristocracy are ill-defined,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everybody lives in constant dread lest advantage should be taken of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,familiarity. Unable to judge at once of the social position of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he meets, an Englishman prudently avoids all contact with them. Men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are afraid lest some slight service rendered should draw them into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an unsuitable acquaintance; they dread civilities, and they avoid the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obtrusive gratitude of a stranger quite as much as his hatred. Many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people attribute these singular anti-social propensities, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reserved and taciturn bearing of the English, to purely physical causes.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I may admit that there is something of it in their race, but much more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of it is attributable to their social condition, as is proved by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contrast of the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America, where the privileges of birth never existed, and where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors, men unacquainted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with each other are very ready to frequent the same places, and find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neither peril nor advantage in the free interchange of their thoughts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If they meet by accident, they neither seek nor avoid intercourse; their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manner is therefore natural, frank, and open: it is easy to see that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they hardly expect or apprehend anything from each other, and that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not care to display, any more than to conceal, their position in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"world. If their demeanor is often cold and serious, it is never haughty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or constrained; and if they do not converse, it is because they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not in a humor to talk, not because they think it their interest to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"silent. In a foreign country two Americans are at once friends, simply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because they are Americans. They are repulsed by no prejudice; they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attracted by their common country. For two Englishmen the same blood,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is not enough; they must be brought together by the same rank. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans remark this unsociable mood of the English as much as the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"French do, and they are not less astonished by it. Yet the Americans are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"connected with England by their origin, their religion, their language,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and partially by their manners; they only differ in their social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition. It may therefore be inferred that the reserve of the English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proceeds from the constitution of their country much more than from that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of its inhabitants.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter III: Why The Americans Show So Little Sensitiveness In Their Own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Country, And Are So Sensitive In Europe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The temper of the Americans is vindictive, like that of all serious and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reflecting nations. They hardly ever forget an offence, but it is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,easy to offend them; and their resentment is as slow to kindle as it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to abate. In aristocratic communities where a small number of persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manage everything, the outward intercourse of men is subject to settled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conventional rules. Everyone then thinks he knows exactly what marks of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect or of condescension he ought to display, and none are presumed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be ignorant of the science of etiquette. These usages of the first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,class in society afterwards serve as a model to all the others; besides,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which each of the latter lays down a code of its own, to which all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its members are bound to conform. Thus the rules of politeness form a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"complex system of legislation, which it is difficult to be perfectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"master of, but from which it is dangerous for anyone to deviate; so that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men are constantly exposed involuntarily to inflict or to receive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bitter affronts. But as the distinctions of rank are obliterated, as men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,differing in education and in birth meet and mingle in the same places,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of resort, it is almost impossible to agree upon the rules of good","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"breeding. As its laws are uncertain, to disobey them is not a crime,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,even in the eyes of those who know what they are; men attach more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"importance to intentions than to forms, and they grow less civil, but at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same time less quarrelsome. There are many little attentions which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an American does not care about; he thinks they are not due to him, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he presumes that they are not known to be due: he therefore either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does not perceive a rudeness or he forgives it; his manners become less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"courteous, and his character more plain and masculine.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The mutual indulgence which the Americans display, and the manly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confidence with which they treat each other, also result from another","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"deeper and more general cause, which I have already adverted to in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,preceding chapter. In the United States the distinctions of rank,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in civil society are slight, in political society they are null; an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"American, therefore, does not think himself bound to pay particular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attentions to any of his fellow-citizens, nor does he require such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attentions from them towards himself. As he does not see that it is his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interest eagerly to seek the company of any of his countrymen, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,slow to fancy that his own company is declined: despising no one on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"account of his station, he does not imagine that anyone can despise him","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for that cause; and until he has clearly perceived an insult, he does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not suppose that an affront was intended. The social condition of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans naturally accustoms them not to take offence in small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"matters; and, on the other hand, the democratic freedom which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoy transfuses this same mildness of temper into the character of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nation. The political institutions of the United States constantly bring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizens of all ranks into contact, and compel them to pursue great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,undertakings in concert. People thus engaged have scarcely time to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attend to the details of etiquette, and they are besides too strongly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interested in living harmoniously for them to stick at such things. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore soon acquire a habit of considering the feelings and opinions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those whom they meet more than their manners, and they do not allow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves to be annoyed by trifles.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have often remarked in the United States that it is not easy to make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a man understand that his presence may be dispensed with; hints will not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always suffice to shake him off. I contradict an American at every word,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he says, to show him that his conversation bores me; he instantly labors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with fresh pertinacity to convince me; I preserve a dogged silence, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he thinks I am meditating deeply on the truths which he is uttering; at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"last I rush from his company, and he supposes that some urgent business","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hurries me elsewhere. This man will never understand that he wearies me,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to extinction unless I tell him so: and the only way to get rid of him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is to make him my enemy for life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It appears surprising at first sight that the same man transported to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Europe suddenly becomes so sensitive and captious, that I often find","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it as difficult to avoid offending him here as it was to put him out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of countenance. These two opposite effects proceed from the same cause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic institutions generally give men a lofty notion of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country and of themselves. An American leaves his country with a heart,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,swollen with pride; on arriving in Europe he at once finds out that we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are not so engrossed by the United States and the great people which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inhabits them as he had supposed, and this begins to annoy him. He has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,been informed that the conditions of society are not equal in our part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the globe, and he observes that among the nations of Europe the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,traces of rank are not wholly obliterated; that wealth and birth still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"retain some indeterminate privileges, which force themselves upon his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notice whilst they elude definition. He is therefore profoundly ignorant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the place which he ought to occupy in this half-ruined scale of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes, which are sufficiently distinct to hate and despise each other,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,yet sufficiently alike for him to be always confounding them. He is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,afraid of ranging himself too high--still more is he afraid of being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ranged too low; this twofold peril keeps his mind constantly on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stretch, and embarrasses all he says and does. He learns from tradition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that in Europe ceremonial observances were infinitely varied according,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to different ranks; this recollection of former times completes his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perplexity, and he is the more afraid of not obtaining those marks of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect which are due to him, as he does not exactly know in what","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they consist. He is like a man surrounded by traps: society is not a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"recreation for him, but a serious toil: he weighs your least actions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interrogates your looks, and scrutinizes all you say, lest there should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be some hidden allusion to affront him. I doubt whether there was ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a provincial man of quality so punctilious in breeding as he is: he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"endeavors to attend to the slightest rules of etiquette, and does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,allow one of them to be waived towards himself: he is full of scruples,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and at the same time of pretensions; he wishes to do enough, but fears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to do too much; and as he does not very well know the limits of the one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or of the other, he keeps up a haughty and embarrassed air of reserve.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But this is not all: here is yet another double of the human heart. An,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American is forever talking of the admirable equality which prevails in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the United States; aloud he makes it the boast of his country, but in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"secret he deplores it for himself; and he aspires to show that, for his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part, he is an exception to the general state of things which he vaunts.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is hardly an American to be met with who does not claim some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remote kindred with the first founders of the colonies; and as for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"scions of the noble families of England, America seemed to me to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"covered with them. When an opulent American arrives in Europe, his first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,care is to surround himself with all the luxuries of wealth: he is so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afraid of being taken for the plain citizen of a democracy, that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adopts a hundred distorted ways of bringing some new instance of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wealth before you every day. His house will be in the most fashionable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,part of the town: he will always be surrounded by a host of servants.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have heard an American complain, that in the best houses of Paris the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society was rather mixed; the taste which prevails there was not pure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enough for him; and he ventured to hint that, in his opinion, there was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a want of elegance of manner; he could not accustom himself to see wit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concealed under such unpretending forms.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These contrasts ought not to surprise us. If the vestiges of former,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic distinctions were not so completely effaced in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"States, the Americans would be less simple and less tolerant in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own country--they would require less, and be less fond of borrowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manners in ours.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IV: Consequences Of The Three Preceding Chapters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When men feel a natural compassion for their mutual sufferings--when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are brought together by easy and frequent intercourse, and no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sensitive feelings keep them asunder--it may readily be supposed that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they will lend assistance to one another whenever it is needed. When an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American asks for the co-operation of his fellow-citizens it is seldom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"refused, and I have often seen it afforded spontaneously and with great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"goodwill. If an accident happens on the highway, everybody hastens to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"help the sufferer; if some great and sudden calamity befalls a family,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the purses of a thousand strangers are at once willingly opened, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,small but numerous donations pour in to relieve their distress. It often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"happens amongst the most civilized nations of the globe, that a poor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wretch is as friendless in the midst of a crowd as the savage in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wilds: this is hardly ever the case in the United States. The Americans,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who are always cold and often coarse in their manners, seldom show","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insensibility; and if they do not proffer services eagerly, yet they do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not refuse to render them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All this is not in contradiction to what I have said before on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,subject of individualism. The two things are so far from combating each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, that I can see how they agree. Equality of conditions, whilst it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"makes men feel their independence, shows them their own weakness: they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are free, but exposed to a thousand accidents; and experience soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"teaches them that, although they do not habitually require the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assistance of others, a time almost always comes when they cannot do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without it. We constantly see in Europe that men of the same profession,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are ever ready to assist each other; they are all exposed to the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ills, and that is enough to teach them to seek mutual preservatives,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,however hard-hearted and selfish they may otherwise be. When one of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them falls into danger, from which the others may save him by a slight","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transient sacrifice or a sudden effort, they do not fail to make the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attempt. Not that they are deeply interested in his fate; for if, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chance, their exertions are unavailing, they immediately forget the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of them, and return to their own business; but a sort of tacit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and almost involuntary agreement has been passed between them, by which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each one owes to the others a temporary support which he may claim for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself in turn. Extend to a people the remark here applied to a class,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and you will understand my meaning. A similar covenant exists in fact,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between all the citizens of a democracy: they all feel themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subject to the same weakness and the same dangers; and their interest,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as well as their sympathy, makes it a rule with them to lend each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other mutual assistance when required. The more equal social conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become, the more do men display this reciprocal disposition to oblige","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each other. In democracies no great benefits are conferred, but good","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"offices are constantly rendered: a man seldom displays self-devotion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but all men are ready to be of service to one another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter V: How Democracy Affects the Relation Of Masters And Servants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"An American who had travelled for a long time in Europe once said to me,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""The English treat their servants with a stiffness and imperiousness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of manner which surprise us; but on the other hand the French sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,treat their attendants with a degree of familiarity or of politeness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which we cannot conceive. It looks as if they were afraid to give,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"orders: the posture of the superior and the inferior is ill-maintained.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The remark was a just one, and I have often made it myself. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always considered England as the country in the world where, in our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, the bond of domestic service is drawn most tightly, and France as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the country where it is most relaxed. Nowhere have I seen masters stand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,so high or so low as in these two countries. Between these two extremes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the Americans are to be placed. Such is the fact as it appears upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"surface of things: to discover the causes of that fact, it is necessary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to search the matter thoroughly.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,No communities have ever yet existed in which social conditions have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been so equal that there were neither rich nor poor, and consequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neither masters nor servants. Democracy does not prevent the existence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of these two classes, but it changes their dispositions and modifies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their mutual relations. Amongst aristocratic nations servants form a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distinct class, not more variously composed than that of masters. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,settled order is soon established; in the former as well as in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"latter class a scale is formed, with numerous distinctions or marked","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gradations of rank, and generations succeed each other thus without any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,change of position. These two communities are superposed one above the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, always distinct, but regulated by analogous principles. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic constitution does not exert a less powerful influence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on the notions and manners of servants than on those of masters; and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"although the effects are different, the same cause may easily be traced.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Both classes constitute small communities in the heart of the nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and certain permanent notions of right and wrong are ultimately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engendered amongst them. The different acts of human life are viewed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one particular and unchanging light. In the society of servants, as in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that of masters, men exercise a great influence over each other: they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acknowledge settled rules, and in the absence of law they are guided by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a sort of public opinion: their habits are settled, and their conduct is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,placed under a certain control.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These men, whose destiny is to obey, certainly do not understand fame,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtue, honesty, and honor in the same manner as their masters; but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have a pride, a virtue, and an honesty pertaining to their condition;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and they have a notion, if I may use the expression, of a sort of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servile honor. *a Because a class is mean, it must not be supposed that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all who belong to it are mean-hearted; to think so would be a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mistake. However lowly it may be, he who is foremost there, and who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has no notion of quitting it, occupies an aristocratic position which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inspires him with lofty feelings, pride, and self-respect, that fit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him for the higher virtues and actions above the common. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic nations it was by no means rare to find men of noble and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"vigorous minds in the service of the great, who felt not the servitude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they bore, and who submitted to the will of their masters without any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fear of their displeasure. But this was hardly ever the case amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the inferior ranks of domestic servants. It may be imagined that he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who occupies the lowest stage of the order of menials stands very low,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indeed. The French created a word on purpose to designate the servants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the aristocracy--they called them lackeys. This word ""lackey""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"served as the strongest expression, when all others were exhausted, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"designate human meanness. Under the old French monarchy, to denote by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a single expression a low-spirited contemptible fellow, it was usual to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"say that he had the ""soul of a lackey""; the term was enough to convey","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all that was intended. [Footnote a: If the principal opinions by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men are guided are examined closely and in detail, the analogy appears","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still more striking, and one is surprised to find amongst them, just as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much as amongst the haughtiest scions of a feudal race, pride of birth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect for their ancestry and their descendants, disdain of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inferiors, a dread of contact, a taste for etiquette, precedents, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,antiquity.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The permanent inequality of conditions not only gives servants certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peculiar virtues and vices, but it places them in a peculiar relation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with respect to their masters. Amongst aristocratic nations the poor man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is familiarized from his childhood with the notion of being commanded:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to whichever side he turns his eyes the graduated structure of society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the aspect of obedience meet his view. Hence in those countries the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"master readily obtains prompt, complete, respectful, and easy obedience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from his servants, because they revere in him not only their master but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the class of masters. He weighs down their will by the whole weight of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the aristocracy. He orders their actions--to a certain extent he even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"directs their thoughts. In aristocracies the master often exercises,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"even without being aware of it, an amazing sway over the opinions, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits, and the manners of those who obey him, and his influence extends","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,even further than his authority.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In aristocratic communities there are not only hereditary families of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servants as well as of masters, but the same families of servants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adhere for several generations to the same families of masters (like two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,parallel lines which neither meet nor separate); and this considerably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"modifies the mutual relations of these two classes of persons. Thus,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,although in aristocratic society the master and servant have no natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resemblance--although, on the contrary, they are placed at an immense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distance on the scale of human beings by their fortune, education, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions--yet time ultimately binds them together. They are connected,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by a long series of common reminiscences, and however different they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may be, they grow alike; whilst in democracies, where they are naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost alike, they always remain strangers to each other. Amongst an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic people the master gets to look upon his servants as an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inferior and secondary part of himself, and he often takes an interest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in their lot by a last stretch of egotism.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Servants, on their part, are not averse to regard themselves in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,light; and they sometimes identify themselves with the person of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"master, so that they become an appendage to him in their own eyes as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well as in his. In aristocracies a servant fills a subordinate position,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which he cannot get out of; above him is another man, holding a superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rank which he cannot lose. On one side are obscurity, poverty, obedience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for life; on the other, and also for life, fame, wealth, and command.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The two conditions are always distinct and always in propinquity; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tie that connects them is as lasting as they are themselves. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,predicament the servant ultimately detaches his notion of interest from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his own person; he deserts himself, as it were, or rather he transports","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself into the character of his master, and thus assumes an imaginary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,personality. He complacently invests himself with the wealth of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who command him; he shares their fame, exalts himself by their rank,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and feeds his mind with borrowed greatness, to which he attaches","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more importance than those who fully and really possess it. There is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something touching, and at the same time ridiculous, in this strange","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confusion of two different states of being. These passions of masters,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when they pass into the souls of menials, assume the natural dimensions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the place they occupy--they are contracted and lowered. What was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pride in the former becomes puerile vanity and paltry ostentation in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,latter. The servants of a great man are commonly most punctilious as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the marks of respect due to him, and they attach more importance to his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,slightest privileges than he does himself. In France a few of these old,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,servants of the aristocracy are still to be met with here and there;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they have survived their race, which will soon disappear with them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,altogether. In the United States I never saw anyone at all like them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The Americans are not only unacquainted with the kind of man, but it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hardly possible to make them understand that such ever existed. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"scarcely less difficult for them to conceive it, than for us to form a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"correct notion of what a slave was amongst the Romans, or a serf in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Middle Ages. All these men were in fact, though in different degrees,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"results of the same cause: they are all retiring from our sight, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disappearing in the obscurity of the past, together with the social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition to which they owed their origin.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Equality of conditions turns servants and masters into new beings, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,places them in new relative positions. When social conditions are nearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, men are constantly changing their situations in life: there is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still a class of menials and a class of masters, but these classes are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not always composed of the same individuals, still less of the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,families; and those who command are not more secure of perpetuity than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those who obey. As servants do not form a separate people, they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no habits, prejudices, or manners peculiar to themselves; they are not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remarkable for any particular turn of mind or moods of feeling. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"know no vices or virtues of their condition, but they partake of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"education, the opinions, the feelings, the virtues, and the vices of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their contemporaries; and they are honest men or scoundrels in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,way as their masters are. The conditions of servants are not less equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than those of masters. As no marked ranks or fixed subordination are to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be found amongst them, they will not display either the meanness or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greatness which characterizes the aristocracy of menials as well as all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other aristocracies. I never saw a man in the United States who reminded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,me of that class of confidential servants of which we still retain a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reminiscence in Europe, neither did I ever meet with such a thing as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lackey: all traces of the one and of the other have disappeared.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democracies servants are not only equal amongst themselves, but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may be said that they are in some sort the equals of their masters. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,requires explanation in order to be rightly understood. At any moment a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servant may become a master, and he aspires to rise to that condition:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the servant is therefore not a different man from the master. Why,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then has the former a right to command, and what compels the latter to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obey?--the free and temporary consent of both their wills. Neither of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them is by nature inferior to the other; they only become so for a time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by covenant. Within the terms of this covenant, the one is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servant, the other a master; beyond it they are two citizens of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,commonwealth--two men. I beg the reader particularly to observe that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this is not only the notion which servants themselves entertain of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own condition; domestic service is looked upon by masters in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,light; and the precise limits of authority and obedience are as clearly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,settled in the mind of the one as in that of the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the greater part of the community have long attained a condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nearly alike, and when equality is an old and acknowledged fact, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public mind, which is never affected by exceptions, assigns certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general limits to the value of man, above or below which no man can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"long remain placed. It is in vain that wealth and poverty, authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and obedience, accidentally interpose great distances between two men;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public opinion, founded upon the usual order of things, draws them to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common level, and creates a species of imaginary equality between them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in spite of the real inequality of their conditions. This all-powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion penetrates at length even into the hearts of those whose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interest might arm them to resist it; it affects their judgment whilst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it subdues their will. In their inmost convictions the master and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servant no longer perceive any deep-seated difference between them, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they neither hope nor fear to meet with any such at any time. They are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore neither subject to disdain nor to anger, and they discern in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other neither humility nor pride. The master holds the contract of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"service to be the only source of his power, and the servant regards","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it as the only cause of his obedience. They do not quarrel about their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reciprocal situations, but each knows his own and keeps it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the French army the common soldier is taken from nearly the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes as the officer, and may hold the same commissions; out of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ranks he considers himself entirely equal to his military superiors, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in point of fact he is so; but when under arms he does not hesitate to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obey, and his obedience is not the less prompt, precise, and ready,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for being voluntary and defined. This example may give a notion of what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,takes place between masters and servants in democratic communities.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would be preposterous to suppose that those warm and deep-seated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affections, which are sometimes kindled in the domestic service of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy, will ever spring up between these two men, or that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will exhibit strong instances of self-sacrifice. In aristocracies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"masters and servants live apart, and frequently their only intercourse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is through a third person; yet they commonly stand firmly by one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,another. In democratic countries the master and the servant are close,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together; they are in daily personal contact, but their minds do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intermingle; they have common occupations, hardly ever common interests.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst such a people the servant always considers himself as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sojourner in the dwelling of his masters. He knew nothing of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forefathers--he will see nothing of their descendants--he has nothing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lasting to expect from their hand. Why then should he confound his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"life with theirs, and whence should so strange a surrender of himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proceed? The reciprocal position of the two men is changed--their mutual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,relations must be so too.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I would fain illustrate all these reflections by the example of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans; but for this purpose the distinctions of persons and places,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must be accurately traced. In the South of the Union, slavery exists;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all that I have just said is consequently inapplicable there. In the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"North, the majority of servants are either freedmen or the children","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of freedmen; these persons occupy a contested position in the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,estimation; by the laws they are brought up to the level of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,masters--by the manners of the country they are obstinately detruded,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from it. They do not themselves clearly know their proper place, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are almost always either insolent or craven. But in the Northern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"States, especially in New England, there are a certain number of whites,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who agree, for wages, to yield a temporary obedience to the will of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their fellow-citizens. I have heard that these servants commonly perform,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the duties of their situation with punctuality and intelligence; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that without thinking themselves naturally inferior to the person who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"orders them, they submit without reluctance to obey him. They appear to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,me to carry into service some of those manly habits which independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and equality engender. Having once selected a hard way of life, they do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not seek to escape from it by indirect means; and they have sufficient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect for themselves, not to refuse to their master that obedience","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they have freely promised. On their part, masters require nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their servants but the faithful and rigorous performance of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"covenant: they do not ask for marks of respect, they do not claim their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"love or devoted attachment; it is enough that, as servants, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are exact and honest. It would not then be true to assert that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic society, the relation of servants and masters is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disorganized: it is organized on another footing; the rule is different,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but there is a rule.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is not my purpose to inquire whether the new state of things which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have just described is inferior to that which preceded it, or simply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different. Enough for me that it is fixed and determined: for what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most important to meet with among men is not any given ordering, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order. But what shall I say of those sad and troubled times at which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality is established in the midst of the tumult of revolution--when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy, after having been introduced into the state of society, still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,struggles with difficulty against the prejudices and manners of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country? The laws, and partially public opinion, already declare that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no natural or permanent inferiority exists between the servant and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the master. But this new belief has not yet reached the innermost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"convictions of the latter, or rather his heart rejects it; in the secret","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persuasion of his mind the master thinks that he belongs to a peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and superior race; he dares not say so, but he shudders whilst he allows","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself to be dragged to the same level. His authority over his servants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,becomes timid and at the same time harsh: he has already ceased to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entertain for them the feelings of patronizing kindness which long,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uncontested power always engenders, and he is surprised that, being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"changed himself, his servant changes also. He wants his attendants to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"form regular and permanent habits, in a condition of domestic service","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which is only temporary: he requires that they should appear contented,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with and proud of a servile condition, which they will one day shake","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,off--that they should sacrifice themselves to a man who can neither,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,protect nor ruin them--and in short that they should contract an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indissoluble engagement to a being like themselves, and one who will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,last no longer than they will.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst aristocratic nations it often happens that the condition of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,domestic service does not degrade the character of those who enter upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it, because they neither know nor imagine any other; and the amazing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inequality which is manifest between them and their master appears to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be the necessary and unavoidable consequence of some hidden law of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Providence. In democracies the condition of domestic service does not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"degrade the character of those who enter upon it, because it is freely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chosen, and adopted for a time only; because it is not stigmatized by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public opinion, and creates no permanent inequality between the servant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the master. But whilst the transition from one social condition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to another is going on, there is almost always a time when men's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,minds fluctuate between the aristocratic notion of subjection and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the democratic notion of obedience. Obedience then loses its moral,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance in the eyes of him who obeys; he no longer considers it as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a species of divine obligation, and he does not yet view it under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its purely human aspect; it has to him no character of sanctity or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of justice, and he submits to it as to a degrading but profitable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition. At that moment a confused and imperfect phantom of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,haunts the minds of servants; they do not at once perceive whether the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality to which they are entitled is to be found within or without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the pale of domestic service; and they rebel in their hearts against a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subordination to which they have subjected themselves, and from which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they derive actual profit. They consent to serve, and they blush to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obey; they like the advantages of service, but not the master; or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rather, they are not sure that they ought not themselves to be masters,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they are inclined to consider him who orders them as an unjust,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,usurper of their own rights. Then it is that the dwelling of every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizen offers a spectacle somewhat analogous to the gloomy aspect of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political society. A secret and intestine warfare is going on there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between powers, ever rivals and suspicious of one another: the master is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ill-natured and weak, the servant ill-natured and intractable; the one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly attempts to evade by unfair restrictions his obligation to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,protect and to remunerate--the other his obligation to obey. The reins,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of domestic government dangle between them, to be snatched at by one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or the other. The lines which divide authority from oppression, liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from license, and right from might, are to their eyes so jumbled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together and confused, that no one knows exactly what he is, or what he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may be, or what he ought to be. Such a condition is not democracy, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolution.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VI: That Democratic Institutions And Manners Tend To Raise Rents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,And Shorten The Terms Of Leases,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"What has been said of servants and masters is applicable, to a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extent, to landowners and farming tenants; but this subject deserves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be considered by itself. In America there are, properly speaking, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tenant farmers; every man owns the ground he tills. It must be admitted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that democratic laws tend greatly to increase the number of landowners,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to diminish that of farming tenants. Yet what takes place in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,United States is much less attributable to the institutions of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country than to the country itself. In America land is cheap, and anyone","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may easily become a landowner; its returns are small, and its produce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot well be divided between a landowner and a farmer. America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore stands alone in this as well as in many other respects, and it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would be a mistake to take it as an example.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe that in democratic as well as in aristocratic countries there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will be landowners and tenants, but the connection existing between them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be of a different kind. In aristocracies the hire of a farm is paid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the landlord, not only in rent, but in respect, regard, and duty;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in democracies the whole is paid in cash. When estates are divided and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passed from hand to hand, and the permanent connection which existed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between families and the soil is dissolved, the landowner and the tenant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are only casually brought into contact. They meet for a moment to settle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the conditions of the agreement, and then lose sight of each other; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are two strangers brought together by a common interest, and who keenly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"talk over a matter of business, the sole object of which is to make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,money.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In proportion as property is subdivided and wealth distributed over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, the community is filled with people whose former opulence is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"declining, and with others whose fortunes are of recent growth and whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wants increase more rapidly than their resources. For all such persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the smallest pecuniary profit is a matter of importance, and none of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them feel disposed to waive any of their claims, or to lose any portion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of their income. As ranks are intermingled, and as very large as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as very scanty fortunes become more rare, every day brings the social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition of the landowner nearer to that of the farmer; the one has not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,naturally any uncontested superiority over the other; between two men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who are equal, and not at ease in their circumstances, the contract of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hire is exclusively an affair of money. A man whose estate extends over,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a whole district, and who owns a hundred farms, is well aware of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance of gaining at the same time the affections of some thousands,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of men; this object appears to call for his exertions, and to attain it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he will readily make considerable sacrifices. But he who owns a hundred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acres is insensible to similar considerations, and he cares but little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to win the private regard of his tenant.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,An aristocracy does not expire like a man in a single day; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic principle is slowly undermined in men's opinion, before it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is attacked in their laws. Long before open war is declared against it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the tie which had hitherto united the higher classes to the lower may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seen to be gradually relaxed. Indifference and contempt are betrayed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one class, jealousy and hatred by the others; the intercourse between","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rich and poor becomes less frequent and less kind, and rents are raised.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This is not the consequence of a democratic revolution, but its certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,harbinger; for an aristocracy which has lost the affections of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people, once and forever, is like a tree dead at the root, which is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more easily torn up by the winds the higher its branches have spread.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the course of the last fifty years the rents of farms have amazingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increased, not only in France but throughout the greater part of Europe.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The remarkable improvements which have taken place in agriculture and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures within the same period do not suffice in my opinion to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,explain this fact; recourse must be had to another cause more powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and more concealed. I believe that cause is to be found in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic institutions which several European nations have adopted, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the democratic passions which more or less agitate all the rest. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have frequently heard great English landowners congratulate themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, at the present day, they derive a much larger income from their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,estates than their fathers did. They have perhaps good reasons to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,glad; but most assuredly they know not what they are glad of. They think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are making a clear gain, when it is in reality only an exchange;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their influence is what they are parting with for cash; and what they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gain in money will ere long be lost in power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is yet another sign by which it is easy to know that a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic revolution is going on or approaching. In the Middle Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost all lands were leased for lives, or for very long terms; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,domestic economy of that period shows that leases for ninety-nine years,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were more frequent then than leases for twelve years are now. Men then,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,believed that families were immortal; men's conditions seemed settled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forever, and the whole of society appeared to be so fixed, that it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was not supposed that anything would ever be stirred or shaken in its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"structure. In ages of equality, the human mind takes a different bent;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the prevailing notion is that nothing abides, and man is haunted by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the thought of mutability. Under this impression the landowner and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the tenant himself are instinctively averse to protracted terms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obligation; they are afraid of being tied up to-morrow by the contract,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which benefits them today. They have vague anticipations of some sudden,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and unforeseen change in their conditions; they mistrust themselves;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they fear lest their taste should change, and lest they should lament","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they cannot rid themselves of what they coveted; nor are such fears,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unfounded, for in democratic ages that which is most fluctuating amidst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the fluctuation of all around is the heart of man.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Chapter VII: Influence Of Democracy On Wages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Most of the remarks which I have already made in speaking of servants,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and masters, may be applied to masters and workmen. As the gradations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the social scale come to be less observed, whilst the great sink the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"humble rise, and as poverty as well as opulence ceases to be hereditary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the distance both in reality and in opinion, which heretofore separated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the workman from the master, is lessened every day. The workman","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conceives a more lofty opinion of his rights, of his future, of himself;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he is filled with new ambition and with new desires, he is harassed by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,new wants. Every instant he views with longing eyes the profits of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"employer; and in order to share them, he strives to dispose of his labor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at a higher rate, and he generally succeeds at length in the attempt.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic countries, as well as elsewhere, most of the branches","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of productive industry are carried on at a small cost, by men little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,removed by their wealth or education above the level of those whom they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,employ. These manufacturing speculators are extremely numerous; their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interests differ; they cannot therefore easily concert or combine their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exertions. On the other hand the workmen have almost always some sure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resources, which enable them to refuse to work when they cannot get","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what they conceive to be the fair price of their labor. In the constant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"struggle for wages which is going on between these two classes, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength is divided, and success alternates from one to the other. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is even probable that in the end the interest of the working class must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prevail; for the high wages which they have already obtained make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them every day less dependent on their masters; and as they grow more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independent, they have greater facilities for obtaining a further","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increase of wages.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I shall take for example that branch of productive industry which is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still at the present day the most generally followed in France, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all the countries of the world--I mean the cultivation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soil. In France most of those who labor for hire in agriculture, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves owners of certain plots of ground, which just enable them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to subsist without working for anyone else. When these laborers come to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"offer their services to a neighboring landowner or farmer, if he refuses","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them a certain rate of wages, they retire to their own small property","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and await another opportunity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I think that, upon the whole, it may be asserted that a slow and gradual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rise of wages is one of the general laws of democratic communities. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proportion as social conditions become more equal, wages rise; and as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wages are higher, social conditions become more equal. But a great and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gloomy exception occurs in our own time. I have shown in a preceding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chapter that aristocracy, expelled from political society, has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"taken refuge in certain departments of productive industry, and has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,established its sway there under another form; this powerfully affects,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the rate of wages. As a large capital is required to embark in the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufacturing speculations to which I allude, the number of persons who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enter upon them is exceedingly limited: as their number is small, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can easily concert together, and fix the rate of wages as they please.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Their workmen on the contrary are exceedingly numerous, and the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of them is always increasing; for, from time to time, an extraordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"run of business takes place, during which wages are inordinately high,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and they attract the surrounding population to the factories. But, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"once men have embraced that line of life, we have already seen that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot quit it again, because they soon contract habits of body and mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which unfit them for any other sort of toil. These men have generally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but little education and industry, with but few resources; they stand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore almost at the mercy of the master. When competition, or other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortuitous circumstances, lessen his profits, he can reduce the wages of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his workmen almost at pleasure, and make from them what he loses by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chances of business. Should the workmen strike, the master, who is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rich man, can very well wait without being ruined until necessity brings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them back to him; but they must work day by day or they die, for their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only property is in their hands. They have long been impoverished by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"oppression, and the poorer they become the more easily may they be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,oppressed: they can never escape from this fatal circle of cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and consequence. It is not then surprising that wages, after having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes suddenly risen, are permanently lowered in this branch of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industry; whereas in other callings the price of labor, which generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increases but little, is nevertheless constantly augmented.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This state of dependence and wretchedness, in which a part of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufacturing population of our time lives, forms an exception to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general rule, contrary to the state of all the rest of the community;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but, for this very reason, no circumstance is more important or more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deserving of the especial consideration of the legislator; for when the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whole of society is in motion, it is difficult to keep any one class","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stationary; and when the greater number of men are opening new paths to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortune, it is no less difficult to make the few support in peace their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wants and their desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VIII: Influence Of Democracy On Kindred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have just examined the changes which the equality of conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,produces in the mutual relations of the several members of the community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst democratic nations, and amongst the Americans in particular.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I would now go deeper, and inquire into the closer ties of kindred: my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object here is not to seek for new truths, but to show in what manner","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,facts already known are connected with my subject.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It has been universally remarked, that in our time the several members","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of a family stand upon an entirely new footing towards each other; that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the distance which formerly separated a father from his sons has been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lessened; and that paternal authority, if not destroyed, is at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impaired. Something analogous to this, but even more striking, may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"observed in the United States. In America the family, in the Roman and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic signification of the word, does not exist. All that remains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of it are a few vestiges in the first years of childhood, when the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"father exercises, without opposition, that absolute domestic authority,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which the feebleness of his children renders necessary, and which their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interest, as well as his own incontestable superiority, warrants. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as soon as the young American approaches manhood, the ties of filial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obedience are relaxed day by day: master of his thoughts, he is soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"master of his conduct. In America there is, strictly speaking, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adolescence: at the close of boyhood the man appears, and begins to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,trace out his own path. It would be an error to suppose that this is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"preceded by a domestic struggle, in which the son has obtained by a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sort of moral violence the liberty that his father refused him. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same habits, the same principles which impel the one to assert","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his independence, predispose the other to consider the use of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence as an incontestable right. The former does not exhibit any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of those rancorous or irregular passions which disturb men long after,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they have shaken off an established authority; the latter feels none of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that bitter and angry regret which is apt to survive a bygone power. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"father foresees the limits of his authority long beforehand, and when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the time arrives he surrenders it without a struggle: the son looks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forward to the exact period at which he will be his own master; and he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enters upon his freedom without precipitation and without effort, as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possession which is his own and which no one seeks to wrest from him. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote a: The Americans, however, have not yet thought fit to strip","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the parent, as has been done in France, of one of the chief elements of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"parental authority, by depriving him of the power of disposing of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,property at his death. In the United States there are no restrictions on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the powers of a testator. In this respect, as in almost all others, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is easy to perceive, that if the political legislation of the Americans","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is much more democratic than that of the French, the civil legislation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the latter is infinitely more democratic than that of the former.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This may easily be accounted for. The civil legislation of France,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was the work of a man who saw that it was his interest to satisfy the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic passions of his contemporaries in all that was not directly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and immediately hostile to his own power. He was willing to allow some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,popular principles to regulate the distribution of property and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government of families, provided they were not to be introduced into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the administration of public affairs. Whilst the torrent of democracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"overwhelmed the civil laws of the country, he hoped to find an easy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shelter behind its political institutions. This policy was at once both,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adroit and selfish; but a compromise of this kind could not last; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the end political institutions never fail to become the image and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,expression of civil society; and in this sense it may be said that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing is more political in a nation than its civil legislation.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It may perhaps not be without utility to show how these changes which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"take place in family relations, are closely connected with the social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and political revolution which is approaching its consummation under,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"our own observation. There are certain great social principles, which a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people either introduces everywhere, or tolerates nowhere. In countries","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are aristocratically constituted with all the gradations of rank,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the government never makes a direct appeal to the mass of the governed:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as men are united together, it is enough to lead the foremost, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rest will follow. This is equally applicable to the family, as to all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracies which have a head. Amongst aristocratic nations, social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"institutions recognize, in truth, no one in the family but the father;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"children are received by society at his hands; society governs him,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he governs them. Thus the parent has not only a natural right, but he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquires a political right, to command them: he is the author and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the support of his family; but he is also its constituted ruler. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies, where the government picks out every individual singly from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the mass, to make him subservient to the general laws of the community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no such intermediate person is required: a father is there, in the eye","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the law, only a member of the community, older and richer than his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sons.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When most of the conditions of life are extremely unequal, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inequality of these conditions is permanent, the notion of a superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,grows upon the imaginations of men: if the law invested him with no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privileges, custom and public opinion would concede them. When, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the contrary, men differ but little from each other, and do not always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remain in dissimilar conditions of life, the general notion of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,superior becomes weaker and less distinct: it is vain for legislation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to strive to place him who obeys very much beneath him who commands; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners of the time bring the two men nearer to one another, and draw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them daily towards the same level. Although the legislation of an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic people should grant no peculiar privileges to the heads,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of families; I shall not be the less convinced that their power is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more respected and more extensive than in a democracy; for I know that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whatsoever the laws may be, superiors always appear higher and inferiors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lower in aristocracies than amongst democratic nations.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When men live more for the remembrance of what has been than for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"care of what is, and when they are more given to attend to what their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ancestors thought than to think themselves, the father is the natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and necessary tie between the past and the present--the link by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the ends of these two chains are connected. In aristocracies, then, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"father is not only the civil head of the family, but the oracle of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"traditions, the expounder of its customs, the arbiter of its manners.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"He is listened to with deference, he is addressed with respect, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the love which is felt for him is always tempered with fear. When the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of society becomes democratic, and men adopt as their general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle that it is good and lawful to judge of all things for one's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"self, using former points of belief not as a rule of faith but simply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as a means of information, the power which the opinions of a father","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exercise over those of his sons diminishes as well as his legal power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Perhaps the subdivision of estates which democracy brings with it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contributes more than anything else to change the relations existing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between a father and his children. When the property of the father of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"family is scanty, his son and himself constantly live in the same place,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and share the same occupations: habit and necessity bring them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together, and force them to hold constant communication: the inevitable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence is a sort of familiar intimacy, which renders authority less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"absolute, and which can ill be reconciled with the external forms","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of respect. Now in democratic countries the class of those who are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possessed of small fortunes is precisely that which gives strength,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the notions, and a particular direction to the manners, of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community. That class makes its opinions preponderate as universally as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its will, and even those who are most inclined to resist its commands","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are carried away in the end by its example. I have known eager opponents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of democracy who allowed their children to address them with perfect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,colloquial equality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, at the same time that the power of aristocracy is declining, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"austere, the conventional, and the legal part of parental authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"vanishes, and a species of equality prevails around the domestic hearth.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I know not, upon the whole, whether society loses by the change, but I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,am inclined to believe that man individually is a gainer by it. I think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, in proportion as manners and laws become more democratic, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,relation of father and son becomes more intimate and more affectionate;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rules and authority are less talked of; confidence and tenderness are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"oftentimes increased, and it would seem that the natural bond is drawn","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,closer in proportion as the social bond is loosened. In a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,family the father exercises no other power than that with which men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,love to invest the affection and the experience of age; his orders would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perhaps be disobeyed, but his advice is for the most part authoritative.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Though he be not hedged in with ceremonial respect, his sons at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accost him with confidence; no settled form of speech is appropriated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the mode of addressing him, but they speak to him constantly, and are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ready to consult him day by day; the master and the constituted ruler,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have vanished--the father remains. Nothing more is needed, in order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to judge of the difference between the two states of society in this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect, than to peruse the family correspondence of aristocratic ages.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The style is always correct, ceremonious, stiff, and so cold that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural warmth of the heart can hardly be felt in the language.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The language, on the contrary, addressed by a son to his father in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic countries is always marked by mingled freedom, familiarity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and affection, which at once show that new relations have sprung up in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the bosom of the family.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A similar revolution takes place in the mutual relations of children. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic families, as well as in aristocratic society, every place","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is marked out beforehand. Not only does the father occupy a separate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rank, in which he enjoys extensive privileges, but even the children","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are not equal amongst themselves. The age and sex of each irrevocably,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"determine his rank, and secure to him certain privileges: most of these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distinctions are abolished or diminished by democracy. In aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"families the eldest son, inheriting the greater part of the property,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and almost all the rights of the family, becomes the chief, and, to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain extent, the master, of his brothers. Greatness and power are for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him--for them, mediocrity and dependence. Nevertheless it would be wrong","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to suppose that, amongst aristocratic nations, the privileges of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eldest son are advantageous to himself alone, or that they excite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing but envy and hatred in those around him. The eldest son commonly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"endeavors to procure wealth and power for his brothers, because the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general splendor of the house is reflected back on him who represents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it; the younger sons seek to back the elder brother in all his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertakings, because the greatness and power of the head of the family","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,better enable him to provide for all its branches. The different members,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an aristocratic family are therefore very closely bound together;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their interests are connected, their minds agree, but their hearts are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seldom in harmony.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democracy also binds brothers to each other, but by very different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"means. Under democratic laws all the children are perfectly equal, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequently independent; nothing brings them forcibly together, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nothing keeps them apart; and as they have the same origin, as they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trained under the same roof, as they are treated with the same care, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as no peculiar privilege distinguishes or divides them, the affectionate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and youthful intimacy of early years easily springs up between them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Scarcely any opportunities occur to break the tie thus formed at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"outset of life; for their brotherhood brings them daily together,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without embarrassing them. It is not, then, by interest, but by common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations and by the free sympathy of opinion and of taste, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy unites brothers to each other. It divides their inheritance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it allows their hearts and minds to mingle together. Such is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the charm of these democratic manners, that even the partisans of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracy are caught by it; and after having experienced it for some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, they are by no means tempted to revert to the respectful and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frigid observance of aristocratic families. They would be glad to retain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the domestic habits of democracy, if they might throw off its social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions and its laws; but these elements are indissolubly united, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is impossible to enjoy the former without enduring the latter.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The remarks I have made on filial love and fraternal affection are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,applicable to all the passions which emanate spontaneously from human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nature itself. If a certain mode of thought or feeling is the result of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"some peculiar condition of life, when that condition is altered nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whatever remains of the thought or feeling. Thus a law may bind two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of the community very closely to one another; but that law being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"abolished, they stand asunder. Nothing was more strict than the tie","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which united the vassal to the lord under the feudal system; at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"present day the two men know not each other; the fear, the gratitude,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the affection which formerly connected them have vanished, and not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a vestige of the tie remains. Such, however, is not the case with those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings which are natural to mankind. Whenever a law attempts to tutor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these feelings in any particular manner, it seldom fails to weaken them;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by attempting to add to their intensity, it robs them of some of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elements, for they are never stronger than when left to themselves.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democracy, which destroys or obscures almost all the old conventional","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rules of society, and which prevents men from readily assenting to new","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ones, entirely effaces most of the feelings to which these conventional","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rules have given rise; but it only modifies some others, and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imparts to them a degree of energy and sweetness unknown before. Perhaps,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is not impossible to condense into a single proposition the whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"meaning of this chapter, and of several others that preceded it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Democracy loosens social ties, but it draws the ties of nature more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tight; it brings kindred more closely together, whilst it places the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,various members of the community more widely apart.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter IX: Education Of Young Women In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"No free communities ever existed without morals; and, as I observed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the former part of this work, morals are the work of woman.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Consequently, whatever affects the condition of women, their habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and their opinions, has great political importance in my eyes. Amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all Protestant nations young women are far more the mistresses of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own actions than they are in Catholic countries. This independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is still greater in Protestant countries, like England, which have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,retained or acquired the right of self-government; the spirit of freedom,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is then infused into the domestic circle by political habits and by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religious opinions. In the United States the doctrines of Protestantism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are combined with great political freedom and a most democratic state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of society; and nowhere are young women surrendered so early or so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,completely to their own guidance. Long before an American girl arrives,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at the age of marriage, her emancipation from maternal control begins;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,she has scarcely ceased to be a child when she already thinks for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"herself, speaks with freedom, and acts on her own impulse. The great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,scene of the world is constantly open to her view; far from seeking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concealment, it is every day disclosed to her more completely, and she","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is taught to survey it with a firm and calm gaze. Thus the vices and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangers of society are early revealed to her; as she sees them clearly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"she views them without illusions, and braves them without fear; for she","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is full of reliance on her own strength, and her reliance seems to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shared by all who are about her. An American girl scarcely ever displays,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that virginal bloom in the midst of young desires, or that innocent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and ingenuous grace which usually attends the European woman in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,transition from girlhood to youth. It is rarely that an American woman,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at any age displays childish timidity or ignorance. Like the young women,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of Europe, she seeks to please, but she knows precisely the cost of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasing. If she does not abandon herself to evil, at least she knows","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that it exists; and she is remarkable rather for purity of manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than for chastity of mind. I have been frequently surprised, and almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frightened, at the singular address and happy boldness with which young","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,women in America contrive to manage their thoughts and their language,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amidst all the difficulties of stimulating conversation; a philosopher,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would have stumbled at every step along the narrow path which they trod,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without accidents and without effort. It is easy indeed to perceive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that, even amidst the independence of early youth, an American woman","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is always mistress of herself; she indulges in all permitted pleasures,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without yielding herself up to any of them; and her reason never allows,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the reins of self-guidance to drop, though it often seems to hold them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,loosely.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In France, where remnants of every age are still so strangely mingled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the opinions and tastes of the people, women commonly receive a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reserved, retired, and almost cloistral education, as they did in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic times; and then they are suddenly abandoned, without a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"guide and without assistance, in the midst of all the irregularities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inseparable from democratic society. The Americans are more consistent.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,They have found out that in a democracy the independence of individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot fail to be very great, youth premature, tastes ill-restrained,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"customs fleeting, public opinion often unsettled and powerless,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"paternal authority weak, and marital authority contested. Under these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"circumstances, believing that they had little chance of repressing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"woman the most vehement passions of the human heart, they held that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the surer way was to teach her the art of combating those passions for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,herself. As they could not prevent her virtue from being exposed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequent danger, they determined that she should know how best to defend","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it; and more reliance was placed on the free vigor of her will than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on safeguards which have been shaken or overthrown. Instead, then, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inculcating mistrust of herself, they constantly seek to enhance their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confidence in her own strength of character. As it is neither possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nor desirable to keep a young woman in perpetual or complete ignorance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they hasten to give her a precocious knowledge on all subjects. Far,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from hiding the corruptions of the world from her, they prefer that she","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should see them at once and train herself to shun them; and they hold it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of more importance to protect her conduct than to be over-scrupulous of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her innocence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Although the Americans are a very religious people, they do not rely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on religion alone to defend the virtue of woman; they seek to arm her,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reason also. In this they have followed the same method as in several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other respects; they first make the most vigorous efforts to bring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual independence to exercise a proper control over itself, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they do not call in the aid of religion until they have reached the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,utmost limits of human strength. I am aware that an education of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,kind is not without danger; I am sensible that it tends to invigorate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the judgment at the expense of the imagination, and to make cold and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,virtuous women instead of affectionate wives and agreeable companions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to man. Society may be more tranquil and better regulated, but domestic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"life has often fewer charms. These, however, are secondary evils, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may be braved for the sake of higher interests. At the stage at which we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are now arrived the time for choosing is no longer within our control; a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic education is indispensable to protect women from the dangers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with which democratic institutions and manners surround them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter X: The Young Woman In The Character Of A Wife,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In America the independence of woman is irrevocably lost in the bonds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of matrimony: if an unmarried woman is less constrained there than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elsewhere, a wife is subjected to stricter obligations. The former makes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her father's house an abode of freedom and of pleasure; the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lives in the home of her husband as if it were a cloister. Yet these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,two different conditions of life are perhaps not so contrary as may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supposed, and it is natural that the American women should pass through","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the one to arrive at the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Religious peoples and trading nations entertain peculiarly serious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions of marriage: the former consider the regularity of woman's life,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as the best pledge and most certain sign of the purity of her morals;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the latter regard it as the highest security for the order and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prosperity of the household. The Americans are at the same time a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"puritanical people and a commercial nation: their religious opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as well as their trading habits, consequently lead them to require","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much abnegation on the part of woman, and a constant sacrifice of her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures to her duties which is seldom demanded of her in Europe. Thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the United States the inexorable opinion of the public carefully,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,circumscribes woman within the narrow circle of domestic interest and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"duties, and forbids her to step beyond it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Upon her entrance into the world a young American woman finds these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions firmly established; she sees the rules which are derived from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them; she is not slow to perceive that she cannot depart for an instant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the established usages of her contemporaries, without putting in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"jeopardy her peace of mind, her honor, nay even her social existence;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and she finds the energy required for such an act of submission in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the firmness of her understanding and in the virile habits which her,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,education has given her. It may be said that she has learned by the use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of her independence to surrender it without a struggle and without a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,murmur when the time comes for making the sacrifice. But no American,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,woman falls into the toils of matrimony as into a snare held out to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her simplicity and ignorance. She has been taught beforehand what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expected of her, and voluntarily and freely does she enter upon this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engagement. She supports her new condition with courage, because she","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,chose it. As in America paternal discipline is very relaxed and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conjugal tie very strict, a young woman does not contract the latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without considerable circumspection and apprehension. Precocious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,marriages are rare. Thus American women do not marry until their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understandings are exercised and ripened; whereas in other countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most women generally only begin to exercise and to ripen their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understandings after marriage.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I by no means suppose, however, that the great change which takes place","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in all the habits of women in the United States, as soon as they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"married, ought solely to be attributed to the constraint of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinion: it is frequently imposed upon themselves by the sole effort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their own will. When the time for choosing a husband is arrived, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cold and stern reasoning power which has been educated and invigorated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the free observation of the world, teaches an American woman that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spirit of levity and independence in the bonds of marriage is a constant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subject of annoyance, not of pleasure; it tells her that the amusements","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the girl cannot become the recreations of the wife, and that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sources of a married woman's happiness are in the home of her husband.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As she clearly discerns beforehand the only road which can lead to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"domestic happiness, she enters upon it at once, and follows it to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,end without seeking to turn back.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The same strength of purpose which the young wives of America display,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in bending themselves at once and without repining to the austere duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of their new condition, is no less manifest in all the great trials","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their lives. In no country in the world are private fortunes more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,precarious than in the United States. It is not uncommon for the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man, in the course of his life, to rise and sink again through all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,grades which lead from opulence to poverty. American women support these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vicissitudes with calm and unquenchable energy: it would seem that their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires contract, as easily as they expand, with their fortunes. *a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,[Footnote a: See Appendix S.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The greater part of the adventurers who migrate every year to people the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"western wilds, belong, as I observed in the former part of this work, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the old Anglo-American race of the Northern States. Many of these men,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who rush so boldly onwards in pursuit of wealth, were already in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoyment of a competency in their own part of the country. They take,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their wives along with them, and make them share the countless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perils and privations which always attend the commencement of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expeditions. I have often met, even on the verge of the wilderness, with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"young women, who after having been brought up amidst all the comforts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the large towns of New England, had passed, almost without any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intermediate stage, from the wealthy abode of their parents to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"comfortless hovel in a forest. Fever, solitude, and a tedious life had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not broken the springs of their courage. Their features were impaired,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and faded, but their looks were firm: they appeared to be at once","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sad and resolute. I do not doubt that these young American women had,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amassed, in the education of their early years, that inward strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which they displayed under these circumstances. The early culture of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the girl may still therefore be traced, in the United States, under the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aspect of marriage: her part is changed, her habits are different, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her character is the same.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XI: That The Equality Of Conditions Contributes To The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Maintenance Of Good Morals In America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Some philosophers and historians have said, or have hinted, that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strictness of female morality was increased or diminished simply by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distance of a country from the equator. This solution of the difficulty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was an easy one; and nothing was required but a globe and a pair of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compasses to settle in an instant one of the most difficult problems in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the condition of mankind. But I am not aware that this principle of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,materialists is supported by facts. The same nations have been chaste or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dissolute at different periods of their history; the strictness or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"laxity of their morals depended therefore on some variable cause, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only on the natural qualities of their country, which were invariable.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not deny that in certain climates the passions which are occasioned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the mutual attraction of the sexes are peculiarly intense; but I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,am of opinion that this natural intensity may always be excited or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,restrained by the condition of society and by political institutions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Although the travellers who have visited North America differ on a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of points, they all agree in remarking that morals are far","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more strict there than elsewhere. It is evident that on this point,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the Americans are very superior to their progenitors the English.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A superficial glance at the two nations will establish the fact.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In England, as in all other countries of Europe, public malice is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly attacking the frailties of women. Philosophers and statesmen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are heard to deplore that morals are not sufficiently strict, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,literary productions of the country constantly lead one to suppose so.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America all books, novels not excepted, suppose women to be chaste,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and no one thinks of relating affairs of gallantry. No doubt this great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regularity of American morals originates partly in the country, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"race of the people, and in their religion: but all these causes, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"operate elsewhere, do not suffice to account for it; recourse must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be had to some special reason. This reason appears to me to be the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle of equality and the institutions derived from it. Equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conditions does not of itself engender regularity of morals, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it unquestionably facilitates and increases it. *a [Footnote a: See,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Appendix T.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst aristocratic nations birth and fortune frequently make two such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different beings of man and woman, that they can never be united to each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other. Their passions draw them together, but the condition of society,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the notions suggested by it, prevent them from contracting a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permanent and ostensible tie. The necessary consequence is a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of transient and clandestine connections. Nature secretly avenges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,herself for the constraint imposed upon her by the laws of man. This is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not so much the case when the equality of conditions has swept away all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the imaginary, or the real, barriers which separated man from woman. No","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,girl then believes that she cannot become the wife of the man who loves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her; and this renders all breaches of morality before marriage very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uncommon: for, whatever be the credulity of the passions, a woman will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hardly be able to persuade herself that she is beloved, when her lover","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is perfectly free to marry her and does not.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The same cause operates, though more indirectly, on married life.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nothing better serves to justify an illicit passion, either to the minds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those who have conceived it or to the world which looks on, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compulsory or accidental marriages. *b In a country in which a woman is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always free to exercise her power of choosing, and in which education","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has prepared her to choose rightly, public opinion is inexorable to her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,faults. The rigor of the Americans arises in part from this cause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They consider marriages as a covenant which is often onerous, but every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of which the parties are strictly bound to fulfil, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they knew all those conditions beforehand, and were perfectly free not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to have contracted them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote b: The literature of Europe sufficiently corroborates this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remark. When a European author wishes to depict in a work of imagination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,any of these great catastrophes in matrimony which so frequently occur,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst us, he takes care to bespeak the compassion of the reader by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bringing before him ill-assorted or compulsory marriages. Although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habitual tolerance has long since relaxed our morals, an author could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hardly succeed in interesting us in the misfortunes of his characters,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,if he did not first palliate their faults. This artifice seldom fails:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the daily scenes we witness prepare us long beforehand to be indulgent.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But American writers could never render these palliations probable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their readers; their customs and laws are opposed to it; and as they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"despair of rendering levity of conduct pleasing, they cease to depict","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. This is one of the causes to which must be attributed the small,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of novels published in the United States.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The very circumstances which render matrimonial fidelity more obligatory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,also render it more easy. In aristocratic countries the object of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,marriage is rather to unite property than persons; hence the husband is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sometimes at school and the wife at nurse when they are betrothed. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot be wondered at if the conjugal tie which holds the fortunes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the pair united allows their hearts to rove; this is the natural result,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the nature of the contract. When, on the contrary, a man always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chooses a wife for himself, without any external coercion or even","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"guidance, it is generally a conformity of tastes and opinions which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brings a man and a woman together, and this same conformity keeps and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fixes them in close habits of intimacy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Our forefathers had conceived a very strange notion on the subject of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,marriage: as they had remarked that the small number of love-matches,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which occurred in their time almost always turned out ill, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resolutely inferred that it was exceedingly dangerous to listen to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dictates of the heart on the subject. Accident appeared to them to be a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,better guide than choice. Yet it was not very difficult to perceive that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the examples which they witnessed did in fact prove nothing at all. For,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the first place, if democratic nations leave a woman at liberty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to choose her husband, they take care to give her mind sufficient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knowledge, and her will sufficient strength, to make so important a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"choice: whereas the young women who, amongst aristocratic nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,furtively elope from the authority of their parents to throw themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their own accord into the arms of men whom they have had neither time,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to know, nor ability to judge of, are totally without those securities.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is not surprising that they make a bad use of their freedom of action,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the first time they avail themselves of it; nor that they fall into such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cruel mistakes, when, not having received a democratic education, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,choose to marry in conformity to democratic customs. But this is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not all. When a man and woman are bent upon marriage in spite of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"differences of an aristocratic state of society, the difficulties to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be overcome are enormous. Having broken or relaxed the bonds of filial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obedience, they have then to emancipate themselves by a final effort","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the sway of custom and the tyranny of opinion; and when at length,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they have succeeded in this arduous task, they stand estranged from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their natural friends and kinsmen: the prejudice they have crossed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"separates them from all, and places them in a situation which soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"breaks their courage and sours their hearts. If, then, a couple married","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in this manner are first unhappy and afterwards criminal, it ought not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be attributed to the freedom of their choice, but rather to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,living in a community in which this freedom of choice is not admitted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Moreover it should not be forgotten that the same effort which makes a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man violently shake off a prevailing error, commonly impels him beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the bounds of reason; that, to dare to declare war, in however just","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a cause, against the opinion of one's age and country, a violent and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adventurous spirit is required, and that men of this character seldom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arrive at happiness or virtue, whatever be the path they follow. And","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this, it may be observed by the way, is the reason why in the most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessary and righteous revolutions, it is so rare to meet with virtuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or moderate revolutionary characters. There is then no just ground,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for surprise if a man, who in an age of aristocracy chooses to consult","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nothing but his own opinion and his own taste in the choice of a wife,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,soon finds that infractions of morality and domestic wretchedness invade,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his household: but when this same line of action is in the natural and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ordinary course of things, when it is sanctioned by parental authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and backed by public opinion, it cannot be doubted that the internal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peace of families will be increased by it, and conjugal fidelity more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rigidly observed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Almost all men in democracies are engaged in public or professional,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,life; and on the other hand the limited extent of common incomes obliges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a wife to confine herself to the house, in order to watch in person and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very closely over the details of domestic economy. All these distinct,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and compulsory occupations are so many natural barriers, which, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"keeping the two sexes asunder, render the solicitations of the one less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequent and less ardent--the resistance of the other more easy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Not indeed that the equality of conditions can ever succeed in making,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men chaste, but it may impart a less dangerous character to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,breaches of morality. As no one has then either sufficient time or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opportunity to assail a virtue armed in self-defence, there will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at the same time a great number of courtesans and a great number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of virtuous women. This state of things causes lamentable cases of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"individual hardship, but it does not prevent the body of society from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"being strong and alert: it does not destroy family ties, or enervate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,morals of the nation. Society is endangered not by the great profligacy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a few, but by laxity of morals amongst all. In the eyes of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislator, prostitution is less to be dreaded than intrigue.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The tumultuous and constantly harassed life which equality makes men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lead, not only distracts them from the passion of love, by denying","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them time to indulge in it, but it diverts them from it by another more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secret but more certain road. All men who live in democratic ages more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or less contract the ways of thinking of the manufacturing and trading,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes; their minds take a serious, deliberate, and positive turn; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are apt to relinquish the ideal, in order to pursue some visible and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proximate object, which appears to be the natural and necessary aim","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their desires. Thus the principle of equality does not destroy the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagination, but lowers its flight to the level of the earth. No men are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less addicted to reverie than the citizens of a democracy; and few of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them are ever known to give way to those idle and solitary meditations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which commonly precede and produce the great emotions of the heart. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is true they attach great importance to procuring for themselves that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sort of deep, regular, and quiet affection which constitutes the charm","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and safeguard of life, but they are not apt to run after those violent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and capricious sources of excitement which disturb and abridge it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am aware that all this is only applicable in its full extent to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America, and cannot at present be extended to Europe. In the course of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the last half-century, whilst laws and customs have impelled several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"European nations with unexampled force towards democracy, we have not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had occasion to observe that the relations of man and woman have become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more orderly or more chaste. In some places the very reverse may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,detected: some classes are more strict--the general morality of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people appears to be more lax. I do not hesitate to make the remark, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am as little disposed to flatter my contemporaries as to malign them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This fact must distress, but it ought not to surprise us. The propitious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,influence which a democratic state of society may exercise upon orderly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits, is one of those tendencies which can only be discovered after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a time. If the equality of conditions is favorable to purity of morals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the social commotion by which conditions are rendered equal is adverse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to it. In the last fifty years, during which France has been undergoing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this transformation, that country has rarely had freedom, always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,disturbance. Amidst this universal confusion of notions and this general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stir of opinions--amidst this incoherent mixture of the just and unjust,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of truth and falsehood, of right and might--public virtue has become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"doubtful, and private morality wavering. But all revolutions, whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may have been their object or their agents, have at first produced","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,similar consequences; even those which have in the end drawn the bonds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of morality more tightly began by loosening them. The violations of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,morality which the French frequently witness do not appear to me to have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a permanent character; and this is already betokened by some curious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,signs of the times.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nothing is more wretchedly corrupt than an aristocracy which retains its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealth when it has lost its power, and which still enjoys a vast deal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of leisure after it is reduced to mere vulgar pastimes. The energetic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions and great conceptions which animated it heretofore, leave it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then; and nothing remains to it but a host of petty consuming vices,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which cling about it like worms upon a carcass. No one denies that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,French aristocracy of the last century was extremely dissolute; whereas,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,established habits and ancient belief still preserved some respect for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,morality amongst the other classes of society. Nor will it be contested,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that at the present day the remnants of that same aristocracy exhibit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a certain severity of morals; whilst laxity of morals appears to have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spread amongst the middle and lower ranks. So that the same families,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which were most profligate fifty years ago are nowadays the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exemplary, and democracy seems only to have strengthened the morality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the aristocratic classes. The French Revolution, by dividing the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortunes of the nobility, by forcing them to attend assiduously to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affairs and to their families, by making them live under the same roof","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with their children, and in short by giving a more rational and serious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"turn to their minds, has imparted to them, almost without their being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aware of it, a reverence for religious belief, a love of order, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tranquil pleasures, of domestic endearments, and of comfort; whereas the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rest of the nation, which had naturally these same tastes, was carried","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,away into excesses by the effort which was required to overthrow the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,laws and political habits of the country. The old French aristocracy has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undergone the consequences of the Revolution, but it neither felt the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolutionary passions nor shared in the anarchical excitement which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,produced that crisis; it may easily be conceived that this aristocracy,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"feels the salutary influence of the Revolution in its manners, before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those who achieve it. It may therefore be said, though at first it seems","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"paradoxical, that, at the present day, the most anti-democratic classes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the nation principally exhibit the kind of morality which may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reasonably be anticipated from democracy. I cannot but think that when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"we shall have obtained all the effects of this democratic Revolution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"after having got rid of the tumult it has caused, the observations which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are now only applicable to the few will gradually become true of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whole community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XII: How The Americans Understand The Equality Of The Sexes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I Have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not ultimately affect that great inequality of man and woman which has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"generally speaking, will raise woman and make her more and more the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on both the same duties, and grant to both the same rights; they would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mix them in all things--their occupations, their pleasures, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a medley of the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and disorderly women. It is not thus that the Americans understand that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,species of democratic equality which may be established between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sexes. They admit, that as nature has appointed such wide differences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each of them to fulfil their respective tasks in the best possible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the great work of society may be the better carried on.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes, and to make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways which are always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different. American women never manage the outward concerns of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"family, or conduct a business, or take a part in political life; nor are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they, on the other hand, ever compelled to perform the rough labor of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the fields, or to make any of those laborious exertions which demand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the exertion of physical strength. No families are so poor as to form,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an exception to this rule. If on the one hand an American woman cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"escape from the quiet circle of domestic employments, on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hand she is never forced to go beyond it. Hence it is that the women of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America, who often exhibit a masculine strength of understanding and a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manly energy, generally preserve great delicacy of personal appearance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and always retain the manners of women, although they sometimes show","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they have the hearts and minds of men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nor have the Americans ever supposed that one consequence of democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principles is the subversion of marital power, of the confusion of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural authorities in families. They hold that every association must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have a head in order to accomplish its object, and that the natural head","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the conjugal association is man. They do not therefore deny him the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"right of directing his partner; and they maintain, that in the smaller","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"association of husband and wife, as well as in the great social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, the object of democracy is to regulate and legalize the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers which are necessary, not to subvert all power. This opinion is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not peculiar to one sex, and contested by the other: I never observed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the women of America consider conjugal authority as a fortunate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"usurpation of their rights, nor that they thought themselves degraded by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"submitting to it. It appeared to me, on the contrary, that they attach a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sort of pride to the voluntary surrender of their own will, and make it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their boast to bend themselves to the yoke, not to shake it off. Such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at least is the feeling expressed by the most virtuous of their sex; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,others are silent; and in the United States it is not the practice for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a guilty wife to clamor for the rights of women, whilst she is trampling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on her holiest duties.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It has often been remarked that in Europe a certain degree of contempt,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lurks even in the flattery which men lavish upon women: although a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"European frequently affects to be the slave of woman, it may be seen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that he never sincerely thinks her his equal. In the United States men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seldom compliment women, but they daily show how much they esteem them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,They constantly display an entire confidence in the understanding of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wife, and a profound respect for her freedom; they have decided that her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mind is just as fitted as that of a man to discover the plain truth, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her heart as firm to embrace it; and they have never sought to place her,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtue, any more than his, under the shelter of prejudice, ignorance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and fear. It would seem that in Europe, where man so easily submits to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the despotic sway of women, they are nevertheless curtailed of some of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the greatest qualities of the human species, and considered as seductive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but imperfect beings; and (what may well provoke astonishment) women,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ultimately look upon themselves in the same light, and almost consider","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it as a privilege that they are entitled to show themselves futile,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"feeble, and timid. The women of America claim no such privileges.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Again, it may be said that in our morals we have reserved strange","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immunities to man; so that there is, as it were, one virtue for his use,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and another for the guidance of his partner; and that, according to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinion of the public, the very same act may be punished alternately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as a crime or only as a fault. The Americans know not this iniquitous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,division of duties and rights; amongst them the seducer is as much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dishonored as his victim. It is true that the Americans rarely lavish,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon women those eager attentions which are commonly paid them in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Europe; but their conduct to women always implies that they suppose them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be virtuous and refined; and such is the respect entertained for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the moral freedom of the sex, that in the presence of a woman the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most guarded language is used, lest her ear should be offended by an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expression. In America a young unmarried woman may, alone and without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fear, undertake a long journey.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The legislators of the United States, who have mitigated almost all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"penalties of criminal law, still make rape a capital offence, and no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,crime is visited with more inexorable severity by public opinion.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This may be accounted for; as the Americans can conceive nothing more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"precious than a woman's honor, and nothing which ought so much to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respected as her independence, they hold that no punishment is too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"severe for the man who deprives her of them against her will. In France,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"where the same offence is visited with far milder penalties, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently difficult to get a verdict from a jury against the prisoner.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Is this a consequence of contempt of decency or contempt of women? I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot but believe that it is a contempt of one and of the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus the Americans do not think that man and woman have either the duty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or the right to perform the same offices, but they show an equal regard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for both their respective parts; and though their lot is different, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consider both of them as beings of equal value. They do not give to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,courage of woman the same form or the same direction as to that of man;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but they never doubt her courage: and if they hold that man and his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,partner ought not always to exercise their intellect and understanding,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the same manner, they at least believe the understanding of the one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be as sound as that of the other, and her intellect to be as clear.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, then, whilst they have allowed the social inferiority of woman","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to subsist, they have done all they could to raise her morally and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellectually to the level of man; and in this respect they appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to me to have excellently understood the true principle of democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"improvement. As for myself, I do not hesitate to avow that, although","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dependence, I have nowhere seen woman occupying a loftier position; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"if I were asked, now that I am drawing to the close of this work, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which I have spoken of so many important things done by the Americans,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply--to the superiority of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their women.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIII: That The Principle Of Equality Naturally Divides The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans Into A Number Of Small Private Circles,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It may probably be supposed that the final consequence and necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,effect of democratic institutions is to confound together all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of the community in private as well as in public life, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compel them all to live in common; but this would be to ascribe a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very coarse and oppressive form to the equality which originates in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy. No state of society or laws can render men so much alike,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but that education, fortune, and tastes will interpose some differences","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between them; and, though different men may sometimes find it their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interest to combine for the same purposes, they will never make it their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasure. They will therefore always tend to evade the provisions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislation, whatever they may be; and departing in some one respect","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the circle within which they were to be bounded, they will set up,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"close by the great political community, small private circles, united","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"together by the similitude of their conditions, habits, and manners.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States the citizens have no sort of pre-eminence over each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other; they owe each other no mutual obedience or respect; they all meet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for the administration of justice, for the government of the State, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in general to treat of the affairs which concern their common welfare;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but I never heard that attempts have been made to bring them all to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"follow the same diversions, or to amuse themselves promiscuously in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same places of recreation. The Americans, who mingle so readily in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"political assemblies and courts of justice, are wont on the contrary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"carefully to separate into small distinct circles, in order to indulge","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by themselves in the enjoyments of private life. Each of them is willing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to acknowledge all his fellow-citizens as his equals, but he will only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,receive a very limited number of them amongst his friends or his guests.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This appears to me to be very natural. In proportion as the circle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public society is extended, it may be anticipated that the sphere of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private intercourse will be contracted; far from supposing that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of modern society will ultimately live in common, I am afraid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they may end by forming nothing but small coteries.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Amongst aristocratic nations the different classes are like vast,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chambers, out of which it is impossible to get, into which it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,impossible to enter. These classes have no communication with each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, but within their pale men necessarily live in daily contact;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"even though they would not naturally suit, the general conformity of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,similar condition brings them nearer together. But when neither law nor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,custom professes to establish frequent and habitual relations between,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain men, their intercourse originates in the accidental analogy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of opinions and tastes; hence private society is infinitely varied. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies, where the members of the community never differ much from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each other, and naturally stand in such propinquity that they may all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at any time be confounded in one general mass, numerous artificial and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arbitrary distinctions spring up, by means of which every man hopes to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"keep himself aloof, lest he should be carried away in the crowd against","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his will. This can never fail to be the case; for human institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may be changed, but not man: whatever may be the general endeavor of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community to render its members equal and alike, the personal pride","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of individuals will always seek to rise above the line, and to form","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,somewhere an inequality to their own advantage.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In aristocracies men are separated from each other by lofty stationary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,barriers; in democracies they are divided by a number of small and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost invisible threads, which are constantly broken or moved from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"place to place. Thus, whatever may be the progress of equality, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations a great number of small private communities will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always be formed within the general pale of political society; but none,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of them will bear any resemblance in its manners to the highest class in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracies.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XIV: Some Reflections On American Manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nothing seems at first sight less important than the outward form of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"human actions, yet there is nothing upon which men set more store: they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,grow used to everything except to living in a society which has not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own manners. The influence of the social and political state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a country upon manners is therefore deserving of serious examination.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Manners are, generally, the product of the very basis of the character","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a people, but they are also sometimes the result of an arbitrary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,convention between certain men; thus they are at once natural and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acquired. When certain men perceive that they are the foremost persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in society, without contestation and without effort--when they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constantly engaged on large objects, leaving the more minute details to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,others--and when they live in the enjoyment of wealth which they did not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amass and which they do not fear to lose, it may be supposed that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feel a kind of haughty disdain of the petty interests and practical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cares of life, and that their thoughts assume a natural greatness, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their language and their manners denote. In democratic countries manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are generally devoid of dignity, because private life is there extremely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"petty in its character; and they are frequently low, because the mind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has few opportunities of rising above the engrossing cares of domestic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interests. True dignity in manners consists in always taking one's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proper station, neither too high nor too low; and this is as much within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the reach of a peasant as of a prince. In democracies all stations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appear doubtful; hence it is that the manners of democracies, though","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"often full of arrogance, are commonly wanting in dignity, and, moreover,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are never either well disciplined or accomplished.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The men who live in democracies are too fluctuating for a certain number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of them ever to succeed in laying down a code of good breeding, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forcing people to follow it. Every man therefore behaves after his own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fashion, and there is always a certain incoherence in the manners of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"such times, because they are moulded upon the feelings and notions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each individual, rather than upon an ideal model proposed for general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imitation. This, however, is much more perceptible at the time when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an aristocracy has just been overthrown than after it has long been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,destroyed. New political institutions and new social elements then bring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the same places of resort, and frequently compel to live in common,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men whose education and habits are still amazingly dissimilar, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this renders the motley composition of society peculiarly visible. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"existence of a former strict code of good breeding is still remembered,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but what it contained or where it is to be found is already forgotten.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men have lost the common law of manners, and they have not yet made up","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their minds to do without it; but everyone endeavors to make to himself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"some sort of arbitrary and variable rule, from the remnant of former","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,usages; so that manners have neither the regularity and the dignity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they often display amongst aristocratic nations, nor the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,simplicity and freedom which they sometimes assume in democracies; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are at once constrained and without constraint.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This, however, is not the normal state of things. When the equality of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions is long established and complete, as all men entertain nearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same notions and do nearly the same things, they do not require to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,agree or to copy from one another in order to speak or act in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manner: their manners are constantly characterized by a number of lesser,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diversities, but not by any great differences. They are never perfectly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike, because they do not copy from the same pattern; they are never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very unlike, because their social condition is the same. At first sight","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a traveller would observe that the manners of all the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are exactly similar; it is only upon close examination that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiarities in which they differ may be detected.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The English make game of the manners of the Americans; but it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,singular that most of the writers who have drawn these ludicrous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"delineations belonged themselves to the middle classes in England, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whom the same delineations are exceedingly applicable: so that these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pitiless censors for the most part furnish an example of the very thing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they blame in the United States; they do not perceive that they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"deriding themselves, to the great amusement of the aristocracy of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Nothing is more prejudicial to democracy than its outward forms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"behavior: many men would willingly endure its vices, who cannot support","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its manners. I cannot, however, admit that there is nothing commendable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the manners of a democratic people. Amongst aristocratic nations, all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who live within reach of the first class in society commonly strain to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be like it, which gives rise to ridiculous and insipid imitations. As a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people does not possess any models of high breeding, at least","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it escapes the daily necessity of seeing wretched copies of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In democracies manners are never so refined as amongst aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, but on the other hand they are never so coarse. Neither the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"coarse oaths of the populace, nor the elegant and choice expressions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the nobility are to be heard there: the manners of such a people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are often vulgar, but they are neither brutal nor mean. I have already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,observed that in democracies no such thing as a regular code of good,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,breeding can be laid down; this has some inconveniences and some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantages. In aristocracies the rules of propriety impose the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,demeanor on everyone; they make all the members of the same class appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike, in spite of their private inclinations; they adorn and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceal the natural man. Amongst a democratic people manners are neither,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so tutored nor so uniform, but they are frequently more sincere. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"form, as it were, a light and loosely woven veil, through which the real","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings and private opinions of each individual are easily discernible.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The form and the substance of human actions often, therefore, stand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in closer relation; and if the great picture of human life be less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"embellished, it is more true. Thus it may be said, in one sense, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the effect of democracy is not exactly to give men any particular,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners, but to prevent them from having manners at all.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The feelings, the passions, the virtues, and the vices of an aristocracy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may sometimes reappear in a democracy, but not its manners; they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lost, and vanish forever, as soon as the democratic revolution is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,completed. It would seem that nothing is more lasting than the manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of an aristocratic class, for they are preserved by that class for some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time after it has lost its wealth and its power--nor so fleeting, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no sooner have they disappeared than not a trace of them is to be found;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it is scarcely possible to say what they have been as soon as they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have ceased to be. A change in the state of society works this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"miracle, and a few generations suffice to consummate it. The principal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,characteristics of aristocracy are handed down by history after an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy is destroyed, but the light and exquisite touches of manners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are effaced from men's memories almost immediately after its fall. Men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can no longer conceive what these manners were when they have ceased to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"witness them; they are gone, and their departure was unseen, unfelt; for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in order to feel that refined enjoyment which is derived from choice and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distinguished manners, habit and education must have prepared the heart,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the taste for them is lost almost as easily as the practice of them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus not only a democratic people cannot have aristocratic manners, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they neither comprehend nor desire them; and as they never have thought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of them, it is to their minds as if such things had never been. Too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much importance should not be attached to this loss, but it may well be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,regretted.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am aware that it has not unfrequently happened that the same men have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had very high-bred manners and very low-born feelings: the interior of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,courts has sufficiently shown what imposing externals may conceal the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,meanest hearts. But though the manners of aristocracy did not constitute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtue, they sometimes embellish virtue itself. It was no ordinary sight","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to see a numerous and powerful class of men, whose every outward action","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seemed constantly to be dictated by a natural elevation of thought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and feeling, by delicacy and regularity of taste, and by urbanity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of manners. Those manners threw a pleasing illusory charm over human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nature; and though the picture was often a false one, it could not be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,viewed without a noble satisfaction.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Them From Often Committing Inconsiderate Actions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple, turbulent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or coarse diversions in which the people indulge in aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,communities: such diversions are thought by them to be puerile or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insipid. Nor have they a greater inclination for the intellectual and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,refined amusements of the aristocratic classes. They want something,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,productive and substantial in their pleasures; they want to mix actual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fruition with their joy. In aristocratic communities the people readily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"give themselves up to bursts of tumultuous and boisterous gayety, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shake off at once the recollection of their privations: the natives of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies are not fond of being thus violently broken in upon, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they never lose sight of their own selves without regret. They prefer to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are like business, and which do not drive business wholly from their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"minds. An American, instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at some place of public resort, as the fellows of his calling continue","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to do throughout the greater part of Europe, shuts himself up at home","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to drink. He thus enjoys two pleasures; he can go on thinking of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"business, and he can get drunk decently by his own fireside.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I thought that the English constituted the most serious nation on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"face of the earth, but I have since seen the Americans and have changed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,my opinion. I do not mean to say that temperament has not a great deal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to do with the character of the inhabitants of the United States, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think that their political institutions are a still more influential,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cause. I believe the seriousness of the Americans arises partly from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their pride. In democratic countries even poor men entertain a lofty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notion of their personal importance: they look upon themselves with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"complacency, and are apt to suppose that others are looking at them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,too. With this disposition they watch their language and their actions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with care, and do not lay themselves open so as to betray their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deficiencies; to preserve their dignity they think it necessary to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,retain their gravity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But I detect another more deep-seated and powerful cause which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,instinctively produces amongst the Americans this astonishing gravity.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Under a despotism communities give way at times to bursts of vehement,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"joy; but they are generally gloomy and moody, because they are afraid.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Under absolute monarchies tempered by the customs and manners of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, their spirits are often cheerful and even, because as they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"some freedom and a good deal of security, they are exempted from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most important cares of life; but all free peoples are serious, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their minds are habitually absorbed by the contemplation of some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dangerous or difficult purpose. This is more especially the case amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those free nations which form democratic communities. Then there are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,serious affairs of the government; and those whose thoughts are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the acquisition of a private fortune. Amongst such a people a serious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"demeanor ceases to be peculiar to certain men, and becomes a habit of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the nation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We are told of small democracies in the days of antiquity, in which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizens met upon the public places with garlands of roses, and spent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all their time in dancing and theatrical amusements. I do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"believe in such republics any more than in that of Plato; or, if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"things we read of really happened, I do not hesitate to affirm that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these supposed democracies were composed of very different elements from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ours, and that they had nothing in common with the latter except their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"name. But it must not be supposed that, in the midst of all their toils,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the people who live in democracies think themselves to be pitied; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contrary is remarked to be the case. No men are fonder of their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition. Life would have no relish for them if they were delivered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the anxieties which harass them, and they show more attachment to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their cares than aristocratic nations to their pleasures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am next led to inquire how it is that these same democratic nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are so serious, sometimes act in so inconsiderate a manner. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans, who almost always preserve a staid demeanor and a frigid air,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nevertheless frequently allow themselves to be borne away, far beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the bound of reason, by a sudden passion or a hasty opinion, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sometimes gravely commit strange absurdities. This contrast ought not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,surprise us. There is one sort of ignorance which originates in extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"publicity. In despotic States men know not how to act, because they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"told nothing; in democratic nations they often act at random, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing is to be left untold. The former do not know--the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forget; and the chief features of each picture are lost to them in a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bewilderment of details.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is astonishing what imprudent language a public man may sometimes use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in free countries, and especially in democratic States, without being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compromised; whereas in absolute monarchies a few words dropped by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accident are enough to unmask him forever, and ruin him without hope of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,redemption. This is explained by what goes before. When a man speaks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the midst of a great crowd, many of his words are not heard, or are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forthwith obliterated from the memories of those who hear them; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amidst the silence of a mute and motionless throng the slightest whisper,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strikes the ear.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In democracies men are never stationary; a thousand chances waft them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to and fro, and their life is always the sport of unforeseen or (so to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,speak) extemporaneous circumstances. Thus they are often obliged to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do things which they have imperfectly learned, to say things they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imperfectly understand, and to devote themselves to work for which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are unprepared by long apprenticeship. In aristocracies every man has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one sole object which he unceasingly pursues, but amongst democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations the existence of man is more complex; the same mind will almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always embrace several objects at the same time, and these objects are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently wholly foreign to each other: as it cannot know them all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well, the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the inhabitant of democracies is not urged by his wants, he is so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at least by his desires; for of all the possessions which he sees around,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him, none are wholly beyond his reach. He therefore does everything in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hurry, he is always satisfied with ""pretty well,"" and never pauses more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than an instant to consider what he has been doing. His curiosity is at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,once insatiable and cheaply satisfied; for he cares more to know a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,deal quickly than to know anything well: he has no time and but little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,taste to search things to the bottom. Thus then democratic peoples are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"grave, because their social and political condition constantly leads","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them to engage in serious occupations; and they act inconsiderately,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because they give but little time and attention to each of these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occupations. The habit of inattention must be considered as the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bane of the democratic character.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,And Captious Than That Of The English,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"All free nations are vainglorious, but national pride is not displayed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by all in the same manner. The Americans in their intercourse with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strangers appear impatient of the smallest censure and insatiable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of praise. The most slender eulogium is acceptable to them; the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exalted seldom contents them; they unceasingly harass you to extort,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"praise, and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves. It would seem as if, doubting their own merit, they wished","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes. Their vanity is not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only greedy, but restless and jealous; it will grant nothing, whilst it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"demands everything, but is ready to beg and to quarrel at the same time.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If I say to an American that the country he lives in is a fine one,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Ay,"" he replies, ""there is not its fellow in the world."" If I applaud","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the freedom which its inhabitants enjoy, he answers, ""Freedom is a fine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thing, but few nations are worthy to enjoy it."" If I remark the purity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of morals which distinguishes the United States, ""I can imagine,"" says","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he, ""that a stranger, who has been struck by the corruption of all other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, is astonished at the difference."" At length I leave him to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemplation of himself; but he returns to the charge, and does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,desist till he has got me to repeat all I had just been saying. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,impossible to conceive a more troublesome or more garrulous patriotism;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it wearies even those who are disposed to respect it. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: See Appendix U.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Such is not the case with the English. An Englishman calmly enjoys the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,real or imaginary advantages which in his opinion his country possesses.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If he grants nothing to other nations, neither does he solicit anything","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for his own. The censure of foreigners does not affect him, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,praise hardly flatters him; his position with regard to the rest of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,world is one of disdainful and ignorant reserve: his pride requires no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sustenance, it nourishes itself. It is remarkable that two nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so recently sprung from the same stock, should be so opposite to one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,another in their manner of feeling and conversing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges, upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which their pride rests, without seeking to rely upon the lesser","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantages which accrue to them. As these privileges came to them by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inheritance, they regard them in some sort as a portion of themselves,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or at least as a natural right inherent in their own persons. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore entertain a calm sense of their superiority; they do not dream,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of vaunting privileges which everyone perceives and no one contests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and these things are not sufficiently new to them to be made topics,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conversation. They stand unmoved in their solitary greatness, well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves off, and that no one will attempt to drive them from that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position. When an aristocracy carries on the public affairs, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"national pride naturally assumes this reserved, indifferent, and haughty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"form, which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When, on the contrary, social conditions differ but little, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,slightest privileges are of some importance; as every man sees around,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,himself a million of people enjoying precisely similar or analogous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advantages, his pride becomes craving and jealous, he clings to mere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trifles, and doggedly defends them. In democracies, as the conditions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"life are very fluctuating, men have almost always recently acquired the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantages which they possess; the consequence is that they feel extreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasure in exhibiting them, to show others and convince themselves that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they really enjoy them. As at any instant these same advantages may be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lost, their possessors are constantly on the alert, and make a point","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of showing that they still retain them. Men living in democracies love,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their country just as they love themselves, and they transfer the habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation. The restless and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insatiable vanity of a democratic people originates so entirely in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality and precariousness of social conditions, that the members of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the haughtiest nobility display the very same passion in those lesser,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,portions of their existence in which there is anything fluctuating or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contested. An aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes of the nation, by the extent and perpetuity of its privileges;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it often happens that the only differences between the members who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"belong to it consist in small transient advantages, which may any day be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lost or acquired. The members of a powerful aristocracy, collected in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a capital or a court, have been known to contest with virulence those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frivolous privileges which depend on the caprice of fashion or the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will of their master. These persons then displayed towards each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies, the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their equals contested, and the same desire to parade ostentatiously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those of which they were in possession. If national pride ever entered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into the minds of courtiers, I do not question that they would display","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it in the same manner as the members of a democratic community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVII: That The Aspect Of Society In The United States Is At Once,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Excited And Monotonous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would seem that nothing can be more adapted to stimulate and to feed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"curiosity than the aspect of the United States. Fortunes, opinions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and laws are there in ceaseless variation: it is as if immutable nature,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"herself were mutable, such are the changes worked upon her by the hand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of man. Yet in the end the sight of this excited community becomes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"monotonous, and after having watched the moving pageant for a time the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spectator is tired of it. Amongst aristocratic nations every man is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pretty nearly stationary in his own sphere; but men are astonishingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unlike each other--their passions, their notions, their habits, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their tastes are essentially different: nothing changey, but everything","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"differs. In democracies, on the contrary, all men are alike and do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,things pretty nearly alike. It is true that they are subject to great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and frequent vicissitudes; but as the same events of good or adverse,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortune are continually recurring, the name of the actors only is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"changed, the piece is always the same. The aspect of American society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is animated, because men and things are always changing; but it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"monotonous, because all these changes are alike.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men living in democratic ages have many passions, but most of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passions either end in the love of riches or proceed from it. The cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of this is, not that their souls are narrower, but that the importance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of money is really greater at such times. When all the members of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a community are independent of or indifferent to each other, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,co-operation of each of them can only be obtained by paying for it: this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"infinitely multiplies the purposes to which wealth may be applied, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increases its value. When the reverence which belonged to what is old,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has vanished, birth, condition, and profession no longer distinguish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, or scarcely distinguish them at all: hardly anything but money","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remains to create strongly marked differences between them, and to raise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,some of them above the common level. The distinction originating in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wealth is increased by the disappearance and diminution of all other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,distinctions. Amongst aristocratic nations money only reaches to a few,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,points on the vast circle of man's desires--in democracies it seems to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lead to all. The love of wealth is therefore to be traced, either as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a principal or an accessory motive, at the bottom of all that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans do: this gives to all their passions a sort of family,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"likeness, and soon renders the survey of them exceedingly wearisome.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This perpetual recurrence of the same passion is monotonous; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiar methods by which this passion seeks its own gratification are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no less so.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In an orderly and constituted democracy like the United States, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men cannot enrich themselves by war, by public office, or by political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confiscation, the love of wealth mainly drives them into business and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures. Although these pursuits often bring about great commotions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and disasters, they cannot prosper without strictly regular habits and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a long routine of petty uniform acts. The stronger the passion is, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more regular are these habits, and the more uniform are these acts. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may be said that it is the vehemence of their desires which makes the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans so methodical; it perturbs their minds, but it disciplines","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their lives.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The remark I here apply to America may indeed be addressed to almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all our contemporaries. Variety is disappearing from the human race; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same ways of acting, thinking, and feeling are to be met with all over","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world. This is not only because nations work more upon each other,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and are more faithful in their mutual imitation; but as the men of each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country relinquish more and more the peculiar opinions and feelings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a caste, a profession, or a family, they simultaneously arrive at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something nearer to the constitution of man, which is everywhere the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same. Thus they become more alike, even without having imitated each","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other. Like travellers scattered about some large wood, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"intersected by paths converging to one point, if all of them keep, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eyes fixed upon that point and advance towards it, they insensibly draw","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nearer together--though they seek not, though they see not, though","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they know not each other; and they will be surprised at length to find,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves all collected on the same spot. All the nations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"take, not any particular man, but man himself, as the object of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"researches and their imitations, are tending in the end to a similar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"state of society, like these travellers converging to the central plot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the forest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XVIII: Of Honor In The United States And In Democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Communities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would seem that men employ two very distinct methods in the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,estimation *a of the actions of their fellowmen; at one time they judge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them by those simple notions of right and wrong which are diffused,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all over the world; at another they refer their decision to a few very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,special notions which belong exclusively to some particular age and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country. It often happens that these two rules differ; they sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conflict: but they are never either entirely identified or entirely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"annulled by one another. Honor, at the periods of its greatest power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sways the will more than the belief of men; and even whilst they yield,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without hesitation and without a murmur to its dictates, they feel","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notwithstanding, by a dim but mighty instinct, the existence of a more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general, more ancient, and more holy law, which they sometimes disobey","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,although they cease not to acknowledge it. Some actions have been held,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be at the same time virtuous and dishonorable--a refusal to fight a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,duel is a case in point.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote a: The word ""honor"" is not always used in the same sense","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"either in French or English. I. It first signifies the dignity, glory,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or reverence which a man receives from his kind; and in this sense a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man is said to acquire honor. 2. Honor signifies the aggregate of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rules by the assistance of which this dignity, glory, or reverence is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obtained. Thus we say that a man has always strictly obeyed the laws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of honor; or a man has violated his honor. In this chapter the word is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always used in the latter sense.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think these peculiarities may be otherwise explained than by the mere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"caprices of certain individuals and nations, as has hitherto been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the customary mode of reasoning on the subject. Mankind is subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to general and lasting wants that have engendered moral laws, to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neglect of which men have ever and in all places attached the notion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"censure and shame: to infringe them was ""to do ill""--""to do well"" was to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conform to them. Within the bosom of this vast association of the human,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"race, lesser associations have been formed which are called nations;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and amidst these nations further subdivisions have assumed the names,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of classes or castes. Each of these associations forms, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a separate species of the human race; and though it has no essential,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difference from the mass of mankind, to a certain extent it stands apart","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and has certain wants peculiar to itself. To these special wants must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be attributed the modifications which affect in various degrees and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in different countries the mode of considering human actions, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the estimate which ought to be formed of them. It is the general and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permanent interest of mankind that men should not kill each other: but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it may happen to be the peculiar and temporary interest of a people or a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"class to justify, or even to honor, homicide.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Honor is simply that peculiar rule, founded upon a peculiar state of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society, by the application of which a people or a class allot praise or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,blame. Nothing is more unproductive to the mind than an abstract idea; I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore hasten to call in the aid of facts and examples to illustrate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,my meaning.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I select the most extraordinary kind of honor which was ever known,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the world, and that which we are best acquainted with, viz.,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic honor springing out of feudal society. I shall explain it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by means of the principle already laid down, and I shall explain the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle by means of the illustration. I am not here led to inquire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when and how the aristocracy of the Middle Ages came into existence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"why it was so deeply severed from the remainder of the nation, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what founded and consolidated its power. I take its existence as an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"established fact, and I am endeavoring to account for the peculiar view","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which it took of the greater part of human actions. The first thing that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strikes me is, that in the feudal world actions were not always praised","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or blamed with reference to their intrinsic worth, but that they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sometimes appreciated exclusively with reference to the person who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"was the actor or the object of them, which is repugnant to the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conscience of mankind. Thus some of the actions which were indifferent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on the part of a man in humble life, dishonored a noble; others changed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their whole character according as the person aggrieved by them belonged,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or did not belong to the aristocracy. When these different notions first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arose, the nobility formed a distinct body amidst the people, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it commanded from the inaccessible heights where it was ensconced. To,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"maintain this peculiar position, which constituted its strength, it not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only required political privileges, but it required a standard of right","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and wrong for its own especial use. That some particular virtue or vice,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belonged to the nobility rather than to the humble classes--that certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"actions were guiltless when they affected the villain, which were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,criminal when they touched the noble--these were often arbitrary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,matters; but that honor or shame should be attached to a man's actions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"according to his condition, was a result of the internal constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of an aristocratic community. This has been actually the case in all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the countries which have had an aristocracy; as long as a trace of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle remains, these peculiarities will still exist; to debauch a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,woman of color scarcely injures the reputation of an American--to marry,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,her dishonors him.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In some cases feudal honor enjoined revenge, and stigmatized the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forgiveness of insults; in others it imperiously commanded men to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conquer their own passions, and imposed forgetfulness of self. It did","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not make humanity or kindness its law, but it extolled generosity; it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,set more store on liberality than on benevolence; it allowed men to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enrich themselves by gambling or by war, but not by labor; it preferred","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great crimes to small earnings; cupidity was less distasteful to it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than avarice; violence it often sanctioned, but cunning and treachery it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,invariably reprobated as contemptible. These fantastical notions did not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proceed exclusively from the caprices of those who entertained them. A,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,class which has succeeded in placing itself at the head of and above,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all others, and which makes perpetual exertions to maintain this lofty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position, must especially honor those virtues which are conspicuous for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their dignity and splendor, and which may be easily combined with pride","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the love of power. Such men would not hesitate to invert the natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order of the conscience in order to give those virtues precedence before,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all others. It may even be conceived that some of the more bold and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brilliant vices would readily be set above the quiet, unpretending","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,virtues. The very existence of such a class in society renders these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,things unavoidable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The nobles of the Middle Ages placed military courage foremost amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtues, and in lieu of many of them. This was again a peculiar opinion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which arose necessarily from the peculiarity of the state of society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Feudal aristocracy existed by war and for war; its power had been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"founded by arms, and by arms that power was maintained; it therefore","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"required nothing more than military courage, and that quality was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally exalted above all others; whatever denoted it, even at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expense of reason and humanity, was therefore approved and frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoined by the manners of the time. Such was the main principle; the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,caprice of man was only to be traced in minuter details. That a man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should regard a tap on the cheek as an unbearable insult, and should be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obliged to kill in single combat the person who struck him thus lightly,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is an arbitrary rule; but that a noble could not tranquilly receive an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insult, and was dishonored if he allowed himself to take a blow without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fighting, were direct consequences of the fundamental principles and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wants of military aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus it was true to a certain extent to assert that the laws of honor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were capricious; but these caprices of honor were always confined within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain necessary limits. The peculiar rule, which was called honor by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"our forefathers, is so far from being an arbitrary law in my eyes, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I would readily engage to ascribe its most incoherent and fantastical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,injunctions to a small number of fixed and invariable wants inherent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feudal society.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If I were to trace the notion of feudal honor into the domain of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"politics, I should not find it more difficult to explain its dictates.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The state of society and the political institutions of the Middle Ages,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were such, that the supreme power of the nation never governed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community directly. That power did not exist in the eyes of the people:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every man looked up to a certain individual whom he was bound to obey;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by that intermediate personage he was connected with all the others.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus in feudal society the whole system of the commonwealth rested upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sentiment of fidelity to the person of the lord: to destroy that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sentiment was to open the sluices of anarchy. Fidelity to a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superior was, moreover, a sentiment of which all the members of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracy had constant opportunities of estimating the importance; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every one of them was a vassal as well as a lord, and had to command as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well as to obey. To remain faithful to the lord, to sacrifice one's self","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for him if called upon, to share his good or evil fortunes, to stand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by him in his undertakings whatever they might be--such were the first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,injunctions of feudal honor in relation to the political institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of those times. The treachery of a vassal was branded with extraordinary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"severity by public opinion, and a name of peculiar infamy was invented","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for the offence which was called ""felony.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"On the contrary, few traces are to be found in the Middle Ages of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passion which constituted the life of the nations of antiquity--I mean,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,patriotism; the word itself is not of very ancient date in the language.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"*b Feudal institutions concealed the country at large from men's sight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and rendered the love of it less necessary. The nation was forgotten in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the passions which attached men to persons. Hence it was no part of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the strict law of feudal honor to remain faithful to one's country. Not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indeed that the love of their country did not exist in the hearts of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"our forefathers; but it constituted a dim and feeble instinct, which has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,grown more clear and strong in proportion as aristocratic classes have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been abolished, and the supreme power of the nation centralized. This","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may be clearly seen from the contrary judgments which European nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have passed upon the various events of their histories, according to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,generations by which such judgments have been formed. The circumstance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which most dishonored the Constable de Bourbon in the eyes of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemporaries was that he bore arms against his king: that which most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dishonors him in our eyes, is that he made war against his country; we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"brand him as deeply as our forefathers did, but for different reasons.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote b: Even the word ""patrie"" was not used by the French writers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,until the sixteenth century.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have chosen the honor of feudal times by way of illustration of my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"meaning, because its characteristics are more distinctly marked and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,familiar to us than those of any other period; but I might have taken,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an example elsewhere, and I should have reached the same conclusion by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a different road. Although we are less perfectly acquainted with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Romans than with our own ancestors, yet we know that certain peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notions of glory and disgrace obtained amongst them, which were not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,solely derived from the general principles of right and wrong. Many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"human actions were judged differently, according as they affected a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Roman citizen or a stranger, a freeman or a slave; certain vices were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"blazoned abroad, certain virtues were extolled above all others. ""In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that age,"" says Plutarch in the life of Coriolanus, ""martial prowess","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"was more honored and prized in Rome than all the other virtues, insomuch","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that it was called virtus, the name of virtue itself, by applying the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,name of the kind to this particular species; so that virtue in Latin was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as much as to say valor."" Can anyone fail to recognize the peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,want of that singular community which was formed for the conquest of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,world?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Any nation would furnish us with similar grounds of observation; for,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as I have already remarked, whenever men collect together as a distinct","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, the notion of honor instantly grows up amongst them; that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is to say, a system of opinions peculiar to themselves as to what is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,blamable or commendable; and these peculiar rules always originate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the special habits and special interests of the community. This is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,applicable to a certain extent to democratic communities as well as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to others, as we shall now proceed to prove by the example of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans. *c Some loose notions of the old aristocratic honor of Europe,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are still to be found scattered amongst the opinions of the Americans;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but these traditional opinions are few in number, they have but little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"root in the country, and but little power. They are like a religion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which has still some temples left standing, though men have ceased","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to believe in it. But amidst these half-obliterated notions of exotic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"honor, some new opinions have sprung up, which constitute what may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,termed in our days American honor. I have shown how the Americans are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constantly driven to engage in commerce and industry. Their origin,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their social condition, their political institutions, and even the spot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they inhabit, urge them irresistibly in this direction. Their present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition is then that of an almost exclusively manufacturing and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commercial association, placed in the midst of a new and boundless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, which their principal object is to explore for purposes of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,profit. This is the characteristic which most peculiarly distinguishes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the American people from all others at the present time. All those quiet,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtues which tend to give a regular movement to the community, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"encourage business, will therefore be held in peculiar honor by that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people, and to neglect those virtues will be to incur public contempt.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"All the more turbulent virtues, which often dazzle, but more frequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disturb society, will on the contrary occupy a subordinate rank in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,estimation of this same people: they may be neglected without forfeiting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the esteem of the community--to acquire them would perhaps be to run a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,risk of losing it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote c: I speak here of the Americans inhabiting those States where,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,slavery does not exist; they alone can be said to present a complete,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,picture of democratic society.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The Americans make a no less arbitrary classification of men's vices.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There are certain propensities which appear censurable to the general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reason and the universal conscience of mankind, but which happen to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,agree with the peculiar and temporary wants of the American community:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these propensities are lightly reproved, sometimes even encouraged; for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instance, the love of wealth and the secondary propensities connected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with it may be more particularly cited. To clear, to till, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transform the vast uninhabited continent which is his domain, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,American requires the daily support of an energetic passion; that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passion can only be the love of wealth; the passion for wealth is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore not reprobated in America, and provided it does not go beyond","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the bounds assigned to it for public security, it is held in honor.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The American lauds as a noble and praiseworthy ambition what our own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forefathers in the Middle Ages stigmatized as servile cupidity, just","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as he treats as a blind and barbarous frenzy that ardor of conquest and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,martial temper which bore them to battle. In the United States fortunes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are lost and regained without difficulty; the country is boundless, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its resources inexhaustible. The people have all the wants and cravings,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a growing creature; and whatever be their efforts, they are always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,surrounded by more than they can appropriate. It is not the ruin of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"few individuals which may be soon repaired, but the inactivity and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sloth of the community at large which would be fatal to such a people.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Boldness of enterprise is the foremost cause of its rapid progress, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength, and its greatness. Commercial business is there like a vast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lottery, by which a small number of men continually lose, but the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is always a gainer; such a people ought therefore to encourage and do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,honor to boldness in commercial speculations. But any bold speculation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,risks the fortune of the speculator and of all those who put their trust,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in him. The Americans, who make a virtue of commercial temerity, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no right in any case to brand with disgrace those who practise it. Hence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arises the strange indulgence which is shown to bankrupts in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States; their honor does not suffer by such an accident. In this respect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Americans differ, not only from the nations of Europe, but from all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the commercial nations of our time, and accordingly they resemble none","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of them in their position or their wants.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In America all those vices which tend to impair the purity of morals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to destroy the conjugal tie, are treated with a degree of severity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which is unknown in the rest of the world. At first sight this seems,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strangely at variance with the tolerance shown there on other subjects,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and one is surprised to meet with a morality so relaxed and so austere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst the selfsame people. But these things are less incoherent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than they seem to be. Public opinion in the United States very gently,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,represses that love of wealth which promotes the commercial greatness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the prosperity of the nation, and it especially condemns that laxity","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of morals which diverts the human mind from the pursuit of well-being,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and disturbs the internal order of domestic life which is so necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to success in business. To earn the esteem of their countrymen, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Americans are therefore constrained to adapt themselves to orderly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habits--and it may be said in this sense that they make it a matter of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,honor to live chastely.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,On one point American honor accords with the notions of honor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acknowledged in Europe; it places courage as the highest virtue, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,treats it as the greatest of the moral necessities of man; but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notion of courage itself assumes a different aspect. In the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States martial valor is but little prized; the courage which is best,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,known and most esteemed is that which emboldens men to brave the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangers of the ocean, in order to arrive earlier in port--to support the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privations of the wilderness without complaint, and solitude more cruel","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than privations--the courage which renders them almost insensible to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"loss of a fortune laboriously acquired, and instantly prompts to fresh","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exertions to make another. Courage of this kind is peculiarly necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the maintenance and prosperity of the American communities, and it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,held by them in peculiar honor and estimation; to betray a want of it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to incur certain disgrace.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have yet another characteristic point which may serve to place the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,idea of this chapter in stronger relief. In a democratic society like,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that of the United States, where fortunes are scanty and insecure,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everybody works, and work opens a way to everything: this has changed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the point of honor quite round, and has turned it against idleness.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have sometimes met in America with young men of wealth, personally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disinclined to all laborious exertion, but who had been compelled to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,embrace a profession. Their disposition and their fortune allowed them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to remain without employment; public opinion forbade it, too imperiously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to be disobeyed. In the European countries, on the contrary, where","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy is still struggling with the flood which overwhelms it, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have often seen men, constantly spurred on by their wants and desires,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remain in idleness, in order not to lose the esteem of their equals; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have known them submit to ennui and privations rather than to work.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,No one can fail to perceive that these opposite obligations are two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different rules of conduct, both nevertheless originating in the notion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of honor.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What our forefathers designated as honor absolutely was in reality only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,one of its forms; they gave a generic name to what was only a species.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Honor therefore is to be found in democratic as well as in aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ages, but it will not be difficult to show that it assumes a different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aspect in the former. Not only are its injunctions different, but we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shall shortly see that they are less numerous, less precise, and that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its dictates are less rigorously obeyed. The position of a caste is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,always much more peculiar than that of a people. Nothing is so much out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the way of the world as a small community invariably composed of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same families (as was for instance the aristocracy of the Middle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Ages), whose object is to concentrate and to retain, exclusively and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hereditarily, education, wealth, and power amongst its own members. But","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the more out of the way the position of a community happens to be, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more numerous are its special wants, and the more extensive are its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions of honor corresponding to those wants. The rules of honor will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore always be less numerous amongst a people not divided into,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,castes than amongst any other. If ever any nations are constituted in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which it may even be difficult to find any peculiar classes of society,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the notion of honor will be confined to a small number of precepts,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which will be more and more in accordance with the moral laws adopted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the mass of mankind. Thus the laws of honor will be less peculiar and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less multifarious amongst a democratic people than in an aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,They will also be more obscure; and this is a necessary consequence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of what goes before; for as the distinguishing marks of honor are less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"numerous and less peculiar, it must often be difficult to distinguish","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them. To this, other reasons may be added. Amongst the aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations of the Middle Ages, generation succeeded generation in vain;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each family was like a never-dying, ever-stationary man, and the state","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of opinions was hardly more changeable than that of conditions. Everyone,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"then had always the same objects before his eyes, which he contemplated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the same point; his eyes gradually detected the smallest details,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and his discernment could not fail to become in the end clear and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accurate. Thus not only had the men of feudal times very extraordinary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions in matters of honor, but each of those opinions was present to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their minds under a clear and precise form.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This can never be the case in America, where all men are in constant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"motion; and where society, transformed daily by its own operations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,changes its opinions together with its wants. In such a country men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have glimpses of the rules of honor, but they have seldom time to fix","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attention upon them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"But even if society were motionless, it would still be difficult to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"determine the meaning which ought to be attached to the word ""honor."" In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Middle Ages, as each class had its own honor, the same opinion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was never received at the same time by a large number of men; and this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rendered it possible to give it a determined and accurate form, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"was the more easy, as all those by whom it was received, having a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perfectly identical and most peculiar position, were naturally disposed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to agree upon the points of a law which was made for themselves alone.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus the code of honor became a complete and detailed system, in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"everything was anticipated and provided for beforehand, and a fixed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and always palpable standard was applied to human actions. Amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nation, like the Americans, in which ranks are identified,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the whole of society forms one single mass, composed of elements","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are all analogous though not entirely similar, it is impossible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ever to agree beforehand on what shall or shall not be allowed by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"laws of honor. Amongst that people, indeed, some national wants do exist","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which give rise to opinions common to the whole nation on points of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"honor; but these opinions never occur at the same time, in the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manner, or with the same intensity to the minds of the whole community;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the law of honor exists, but it has no organs to promulgate it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The confusion is far greater still in a democratic country like France,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,where the different classes of which the former fabric of society was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"composed, being brought together but not yet mingled, import day by day","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,into each other's circles various and sometimes conflicting notions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of honor--where every man, at his own will and pleasure, forsakes one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"portion of his forefathers' creed, and retains another; so that, amidst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so many arbitrary measures, no common rule can ever be established, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is almost impossible to predict which actions will be held in honor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and which will be thought disgraceful. Such times are wretched, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are of short duration.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"As honor, amongst democratic nations, is imperfectly defined, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,influence is of course less powerful; for it is difficult to apply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with certainty and firmness a law which is not distinctly known. Public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinion, the natural and supreme interpreter of the laws of honor, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clearly discerning to which side censure or approval ought to lean,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can only pronounce a hesitating judgment. Sometimes the opinion of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public may contradict itself; more frequently it does not act, and lets","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,things pass.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The weakness of the sense of honor in democracies also arises from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"several other causes. In aristocratic countries, the same notions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"honor are always entertained by only a few persons, always limited in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number, often separated from the rest of their fellow-citizens. Honor is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,easily mingled and identified in their minds with the idea of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that distinguishes their own position; it appears to them as the chief,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,characteristic of their own rank; they apply its different rules with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the warmth of personal interest, and they feel (if I may use the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,expression) a passion for complying with its dictates. This truth is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extremely obvious in the old black-letter lawbooks on the subject of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""trial by battel."" The nobles, in their disputes, were bound to use","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the lance and sword; whereas the villains used only sticks amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, ""inasmuch as,"" to use the words of the old books, ""villains","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have no honor."" This did not mean, as it may be imagined at the present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day, that these people were contemptible; but simply that their actions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were not to be judged by the same rules which were applied to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,actions of the aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is surprising, at first sight, that when the sense of honor is most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"predominant, its injunctions are usually most strange; so that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,further it is removed from common reason the better it is obeyed; whence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it has sometimes been inferred that the laws of honor were strengthened,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by their own extravagance. The two things indeed originate from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same source, but the one is not derived from the other. Honor becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fantastical in proportion to the peculiarity of the wants which it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"denotes, and the paucity of the men by whom those wants are felt; and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is because it denotes wants of this kind that its influence is great.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus the notion of honor is not the stronger for being fantastical, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is fantastical and strong from the selfsame cause.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Further, amongst aristocratic nations each rank is different, but all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ranks are fixed; every man occupies a place in his own sphere which he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot relinquish, and he lives there amidst other men who are bound by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same ties. Amongst these nations no man can either hope or fear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,escape being seen; no man is placed so low but that he has a stage of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his own, and none can avoid censure or applause by his obscurity.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic States on the contrary, where all the members of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community are mingled in the same crowd and in constant agitation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public opinion has no hold on men; they disappear at every instant, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,elude its power. Consequently the dictates of honor will be there less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imperious and less stringent; for honor acts solely for the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eye--differing in this respect from mere virtue, which lives upon itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contented with its own approval.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If the reader has distinctly apprehended all that goes before, he will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,understand that there is a close and necessary relation between the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inequality of social conditions and what has here been styled honor--a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"relation which, if I am not mistaken, had not before been clearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pointed out. I shall therefore make one more attempt to illustrate it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,satisfactorily. Suppose a nation stands apart from the rest of mankind:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independently of certain general wants inherent in the human race, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will also have wants and interests peculiar to itself: certain opinions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of censure or approbation forthwith arise in the community, which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peculiar to itself, and which are styled honor by the members of that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community. Now suppose that in this same nation a caste arises, which,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in its turn, stands apart from all the other classes, and contracts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain peculiar wants, which give rise in their turn to special","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions. The honor of this caste, composed of a medley of the peculiar","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notions of the nation, and the still more peculiar notions of the caste,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be as remote as it is possible to conceive from the simple and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general opinions of men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Having reached this extreme point of the argument, I now return. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ranks are commingled and privileges abolished, the men of whom a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is composed being once more equal and alike, their interests and wants","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become identical, and all the peculiar notions which each caste styled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,honor successively disappear: the notion of honor no longer proceeds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from any other source than the wants peculiar to the nation at large,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it denotes the individual character of that nation to the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Lastly, if it be allowable to suppose that all the races of mankind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should be commingled, and that all the peoples of earth should","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ultimately come to have the same interests, the same wants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undistinguished from each other by any characteristic peculiarities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no conventional value whatever would then be attached to men's actions;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they would all be regarded by all in the same light; the general,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessities of mankind, revealed by conscience to every man, would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become the common standard. The simple and general notions of right and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wrong only would then be recognized in the world, to which, by a natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and necessary tie, the idea of censure or approbation would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attached. Thus, to comprise all my meaning in a single proposition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the dissimilarities and inequalities of men gave rise to the notion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,honor; that notion is weakened in proportion as these differences are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obliterated, and with them it would disappear.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,To Be Found In The United States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The first thing which strikes a traveller in the United States is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,innumerable multitude of those who seek to throw off their original,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition; and the second is the rarity of lofty ambition to be observed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the midst of the universally ambitious stir of society. No Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are devoid of a yearning desire to rise; but hardly any appear to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"entertain hopes of great magnitude, or to drive at very lofty aims. All","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are constantly seeking to acquire property, power, and reputation--few","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemplate these things upon a great scale; and this is the more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"surprising, as nothing is to be discerned in the manners or laws of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America to limit desire, or to prevent it from spreading its impulses in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every direction. It seems difficult to attribute this singular state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of things to the equality of social conditions; for at the instant when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that same equality was established in France, the flight of ambition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"became unbounded. Nevertheless, I think that the principal cause which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may be assigned to this fact is to be found in the social condition and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic manners of the Americans.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All revolutions enlarge the ambition of men: this proposition is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiarly true of those revolutions which overthrow an aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When the former barriers which kept back the multitude from fame and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power are suddenly thrown down, a violent and universal rise takes place","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,towards that eminence so long coveted and at length to be enjoyed. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this first burst of triumph nothing seems impossible to anyone: not only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are desires boundless, but the power of satisfying them seems almost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"boundless, too. Amidst the general and sudden renewal of laws and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"customs, in this vast confusion of all men and all ordinances, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,various members of the community rise and sink again with excessive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rapidity; and power passes so quickly from hand to hand that none need,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"despair of catching it in turn. It must be recollected, moreover, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the people who destroy an aristocracy have lived under its laws; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have witnessed its splendor, and they have unconsciously imbibed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings and notions which it entertained. Thus at the moment when an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy is dissolved, its spirit still pervades the mass of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, and its tendencies are retained long after it has been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,defeated. Ambition is therefore always extremely great as long as a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic revolution lasts, and it will remain so for some time after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the revolution is consummated. The reminiscence of the extraordinary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,events which men have witnessed is not obliterated from their memory in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a day. The passions which a revolution has roused do not disappear at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its close. A sense of instability remains in the midst of re-established,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,order: a notion of easy success survives the strange vicissitudes which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gave it birth; desires still remain extremely enlarged, when the means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of satisfying them are diminished day by day. The taste for large,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fortunes subsists, though large fortunes are rare: and on every side we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,trace the ravages of inordinate and hapless ambition kindled in hearts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which they consume in secret and in vain.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"At length, however, the last vestiges of the struggle are effaced; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remains of aristocracy completely disappear; the great events by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its fall was attended are forgotten; peace succeeds to war, and the sway","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of order is restored in the new realm; desires are again adapted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"means by which they may be fulfilled; the wants, the opinions, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the feelings of men cohere once more; the level of the community is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"permanently determined, and democratic society established. A democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation, arrived at this permanent and regular state of things, will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,present a very different spectacle from that which we have just,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"described; and we may readily conclude that, if ambition becomes great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst the conditions of society are growing equal, it loses that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,quality when they have grown so. As wealth is subdivided and knowledge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diffused, no one is entirely destitute of education or of property;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the privileges and disqualifications of caste being abolished, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men having shattered the bonds which held them fixed, the notion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advancement suggests itself to every mind, the desire to rise swells in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every heart, and all men want to mount above their station: ambition is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the universal feeling.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But if the equality of conditions gives some resources to all the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of the community, it also prevents any of them from having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resources of great extent, which necessarily circumscribes their desires","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,within somewhat narrow limits. Thus amongst democratic nations ambition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is ardent and continual, but its aim is not habitually lofty; and life","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is generally spent in eagerly coveting small objects which are within,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reach. What chiefly diverts the men of democracies from lofty ambition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not the scantiness of their fortunes, but the vehemence of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exertions they daily make to improve them. They strain their faculties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the utmost to achieve paltry results, and this cannot fail speedily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to limit their discernment and to circumscribe their powers. They,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,might be much poorer and still be greater. The small number of opulent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizens who are to be found amidst a democracy do not constitute an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exception to this rule. A man who raises himself by degrees to wealth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and power, contracts, in the course of this protracted labor, habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of prudence and restraint which he cannot afterwards shake off. A man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot enlarge his mind as he would his house. The same observation is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"applicable to the sons of such a man; they are born, it is true, in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lofty position, but their parents were humble; they have grown up amidst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feelings and notions which they cannot afterwards easily get rid of;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it may be presumed that they will inherit the propensities of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"father as well as his wealth. It may happen, on the contrary, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the poorest scion of a powerful aristocracy may display vast ambition,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because the traditional opinions of his race and the general spirit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his order still buoy him up for some time above his fortune. Another,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thing which prevents the men of democratic periods from easily indulging,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the pursuit of lofty objects, is the lapse of time which they foresee","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must take place before they can be ready to approach them. ""It is a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great advantage,"" says Pascal, ""to be a man of quality, since it brings","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,one man as forward at eighteen or twenty as another man would be at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fifty, which is a clear gain of thirty years."" Those thirty years","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are commonly wanting to the ambitious characters of democracies. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle of equality, which allows every man to arrive at everything,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prevents all men from rapid advancement.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In a democratic society, as well as elsewhere, there are only a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of great fortunes to be made; and as the paths which lead to them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are indiscriminately open to all, the progress of all must necessarily","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be slackened. As the candidates appear to be nearly alike, and as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is difficult to make a selection without infringing the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, which is the supreme law of democratic societies, the first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,idea which suggests itself is to make them all advance at the same rate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and submit to the same probation. Thus in proportion as men become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more alike, and the principle of equality is more peaceably and deeply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"infused into the institutions and manners of the country, the rules","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of advancement become more inflexible, advancement itself slower, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficulty of arriving quickly at a certain height far greater. From,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hatred of privilege and from the embarrassment of choosing, all men are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at last constrained, whatever may be their standard, to pass the same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ordeal; all are indiscriminately subjected to a multitude of petty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"preliminary exercises, in which their youth is wasted and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagination quenched, so that they despair of ever fully attaining","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what is held out to them; and when at length they are in a condition to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perform any extraordinary acts, the taste for such things has forsaken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In China, where the equality of conditions is exceedingly great and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very ancient, no man passes from one public office to another without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,undergoing a probationary trial. This probation occurs afresh at every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stage of his career; and the notion is now so rooted in the manners of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people that I remember to have read a Chinese novel, in which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hero, after numberless crosses, succeeds at length in touching the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,heart of his mistress by taking honors. A lofty ambition breathes with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficulty in such an atmosphere.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The remark I apply to politics extends to everything; equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,everywhere produces the same effects; where the laws of a country do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not regulate and retard the advancement of men by positive enactment,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,competition attains the same end. In a well-established democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community great and rapid elevation is therefore rare; it forms,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an exception to the common rule; and it is the singularity of such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,occurrences that makes men forget how rarely they happen. Men living in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracies ultimately discover these things; they find out at last that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the laws of their country open a boundless field of action before them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but that no one can hope to hasten across it. Between them and the final,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object of their desires, they perceive a multitude of small intermediate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impediments, which must be slowly surmounted: this prospect wearies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and discourages their ambition at once. They therefore give up hopes so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"doubtful and remote, to search nearer to themselves for less lofty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and more easy enjoyments. Their horizon is not bounded by the laws but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,narrowed by themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have remarked that lofty ambitions are more rare in the ages of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracy than in times of aristocracy: I may add that when, in spite of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these natural obstacles, they do spring into existence, their character","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is different. In aristocracies the career of ambition is often wide, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its boundaries are determined. In democracies ambition commonly ranges,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in a narrower field, but if once it gets beyond that, hardly any limits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can be assigned to it. As men are individually weak--as they live,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"asunder, and in constant motion--as precedents are of little authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and laws but of short duration, resistance to novelty is languid,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the fabric of society never appears perfectly erect or firmly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consolidated. So that, when once an ambitious man has the power in his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"grasp, there is nothing he may noted are; and when it is gone from him,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he meditates the overthrow of the State to regain it. This gives to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great political ambition a character of revolutionary violence, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it seldom exhibits to an equal degree in aristocratic communities. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common aspect of democratic nations will present a great number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"small and very rational objects of ambition, from amongst which a few","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ill-controlled desires of a larger growth will at intervals break out:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but no such a thing as ambition conceived and contrived on a vast scale,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is to be met with there.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have shown elsewhere by what secret influence the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality makes the passion for physical gratifications and the exclusive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,love of the present predominate in the human heart: these different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"propensities mingle with the sentiment of ambition, and tinge it, as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were, with their hues. I believe that ambitious men in democracies are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less engrossed than any others with the interests and the judgment of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,posterity; the present moment alone engages and absorbs them. They are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more apt to complete a number of undertakings with rapidity than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,raise lasting monuments of their achievements; and they care much more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for success than for fame. What they most ask of men is obedience--what,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they most covet is empire. Their manners have in almost all cases,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remained below the height of their station; the consequence is that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequently carry very low tastes into their extraordinary fortunes, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that they seem to have acquired the supreme power only to minister to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their coarse or paltry pleasures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I think that in our time it is very necessary to cleanse, to regulate,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to adapt the feeling of ambition, but that it would be extremely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dangerous to seek to impoverish and to repress it over-much. We should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attempt to lay down certain extreme limits, which it should never be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,allowed to outstep; but its range within those established limits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should not be too much checked. I confess that I apprehend much less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for democratic society from the boldness than from the mediocrity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires. What appears to me most to be dreaded is that, in the midst of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the small incessant occupations of private life, ambition should lose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its vigor and its greatness--that the passions of man should abate, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at the same time be lowered, so that the march of society should every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,day become more tranquil and less aspiring. I think then that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leaders of modern society would be wrong to seek to lull the community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by a state of too uniform and too peaceful happiness; and that it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well to expose it from time to time to matters of difficulty and danger,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in order to raise ambition and to give it a field of action. Moralists,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are constantly complaining that the ruling vice of the present time is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pride. This is true in one sense, for indeed no one thinks that he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not better than his neighbor, or consents to obey his superior: but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is extremely false in another; for the same man who cannot endure,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subordination or equality, has so contemptible an opinion of himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that he thinks he is only born to indulge in vulgar pleasures. He,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"willingly takes up with low desires, without daring to embark in lofty","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enterprises, of which he scarcely dreams. Thus, far from thinking","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that humility ought to be preached to our contemporaries, I would have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,endeavors made to give them a more enlarged idea of themselves and of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their kind. Humility is unwholesome to them; what they most want is,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in my opinion, pride. I would willingly exchange several of our small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,virtues for this one vice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XX: The Trade Of Place-Hunting In Certain Democratic Countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In the United States as soon as a man has acquired some education and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pecuniary resources, he either endeavors to get rich by commerce or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industry, or he buys land in the bush and turns pioneer. All that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"asks of the State is not to be disturbed in his toil, and to be secure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his earnings. Amongst the greater part of European nations, when a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man begins to feel his strength and to extend his desires, the first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thing that occurs to him is to get some public employment. These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opposite effects, originating in the same cause, deserve our passing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notice.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When public employments are few in number, ill-paid and precarious,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst the different lines of business are numerous and lucrative, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to business, and not to official duties, that the new and eager desires","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engendered by the principle of equality turn from every side. But if,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whilst the ranks of society are becoming more equal, the education of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people remains incomplete, or their spirit the reverse of bold--if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commerce and industry, checked in their growth, afford only slow and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arduous means of making a fortune--the various members of the community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"despairing of ameliorating their own condition, rush to the head of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,State and demand its assistance. To relieve their own necessities at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cost of the public treasury, appears to them to be the easiest and most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"open, if not the only, way they have to rise above a condition which no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,longer contents them; place-hunting becomes the most generally followed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of all trades. This must especially be the case, in those great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centralized monarchies in which the number of paid offices is immense,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the tenure of them tolerably secure, so that no one despairs of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obtaining a place, and of enjoying it as undisturbedly as a hereditary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fortune.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I shall not remark that the universal and inordinate desire for place is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a great social evil; that it destroys the spirit of independence in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizen, and diffuses a venal and servile humor throughout the frame","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of society; that it stifles the manlier virtues: nor shall I be at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the pains to demonstrate that this kind of traffic only creates an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unproductive activity, which agitates the country without adding to its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resources: all these things are obvious. But I would observe, that a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government which encourages this tendency risks its own tranquillity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and places its very existence in great jeopardy. I am aware that at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time like our own, when the love and respect which formerly clung to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"authority are seen gradually to decline, it may appear necessary to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those in power to lay a closer hold on every man by his own interest,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and it may seem convenient to use his own passions to keep him in order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and in silence; but this cannot be so long, and what may appear to be a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,source of strength for a certain time will assuredly become in the end a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great cause of embarrassment and weakness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst democratic nations, as well as elsewhere, the number of official","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appointments has in the end some limits; but amongst those nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the number of aspirants is unlimited; it perpetually increases, with a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gradual and irresistible rise in proportion as social conditions become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more equal, and is only checked by the limits of the population.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, when public employments afford the only outlet for ambition, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government necessarily meets with a permanent opposition at last; for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is tasked to satisfy with limited means unlimited desires. It is very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain that of all people in the world the most difficult to restrain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to manage are a people of solicitants. Whatever endeavors are made,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by rulers, such a people can never be contented; and it is always to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,apprehended that they will ultimately overturn the constitution of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, and change the aspect of the State, for the sole purpose of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"making a clearance of places. The sovereigns of the present age, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strive to fix upon themselves alone all those novel desires which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aroused by equality, and to satisfy them, will repent in the end, if I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"am not mistaken, that they ever embarked in this policy: they will one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"day discover that they have hazarded their own power, by making it so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessary; and that the more safe and honest course would have been to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,teach their subjects the art of providing for themselves. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,in Europe. It is regarded by the Americans themselves as one of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great evils of their social condition, and it powerfully affects their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"course of which, property, opinions, and power are rapidly transferred","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from one hand to another. Even after this great revolution is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consummated, the revolutionary habits engendered by it may long be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"traced, and it will be followed by deep commotion. As all this takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,place at the very time at which social conditions are becoming more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, it is inferred that some concealed relation and secret tie exist","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between the principle of equality itself and revolution, insomuch that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the one cannot exist without giving rise to the other.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,On this point reasoning may seem to lead to the same result as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"experience. Amongst a people whose ranks are nearly equal, no ostensible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bond connects men together, or keeps them settled in their station.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,None of them have either a permanent right or power to command--none,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are forced by their condition to obey; but every man, finding himself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possessed of some education and some resources, may choose his won path","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and proceed apart from all his fellow-men. The same causes which make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the members of the community independent of each other, continually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impel them to new and restless desires, and constantly spur them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"onwards. It therefore seems natural that, in a democratic community,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, things, and opinions should be forever changing their form and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"place, and that democratic ages should be times of rapid and incessant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,transformation.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But is this really the case? does the equality of social conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habitually and permanently lead men to revolution? does that state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society contain some perturbing principle which prevents the community,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from ever subsiding into calm, and disposes the citizens to alter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"incessantly their laws, their principles, and their manners? I do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"believe it; and as the subject is important, I beg for the reader's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,close attention. Almost all the revolutions which have changed the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aspect of nations have been made to consolidate or to destroy social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inequality. Remove the secondary causes which have produced the great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"convulsions of the world, and you will almost always find the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of inequality at the bottom. Either the poor have attempted to plunder,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the rich, or the rich to enslave the poor. If then a state of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can ever be founded in which every man shall have something to keep, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"little to take from others, much will have been done for the peace of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the world. I am aware that amongst a great democratic people there will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always be some members of the community in great poverty, and others in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great opulence; but the poor, instead of forming the immense majority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the nation, as is always the case in aristocratic communities, are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"comparatively few in number, and the laws do not bind them together by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the ties of irremediable and hereditary penury. The wealthy, on their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"side, are scarce and powerless; they have no privileges which attract","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public observation; even their wealth, as it is no longer incorporated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and bound up with the soil, is impalpable, and as it were invisible. As","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there is no longer a race of poor men, so there is no longer a race of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rich men; the latter spring up daily from the multitude, and relapse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into it again. Hence they do not form a distinct class, which may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"easily marked out and plundered; and, moreover, as they are connected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with the mass of their fellow-citizens by a thousand secret ties, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people cannot assail them without inflicting an injury upon itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Between these two extremes of democratic communities stand an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"innumerable multitude of men almost alike, who, without being exactly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"either rich or poor, are possessed of sufficient property to desire the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"maintenance of order, yet not enough to excite envy. Such men are the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural enemies of violent commotions: their stillness keeps all beneath,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them and above them still, and secures the balance of the fabric of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society. Not indeed that even these men are contented with what they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have gotten, or that they feel a natural abhorrence for a revolution in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which they might share the spoil without sharing the calamity; on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, they desire, with unexampled ardor, to get rich, but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficulty is to know from whom riches can be taken. The same state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society which constantly prompts desires, restrains these desires","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,within necessary limits: it gives men more liberty of changing and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interest in change.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Not only are the men of democracies not naturally desirous of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutions, but they are afraid of them. All revolutions more or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less threaten the tenure of property: but most of those who live in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic countries are possessed of property--not only are they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possessed of property, but they live in the condition of men who set the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greatest store upon their property. If we attentively consider each of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the classes of which society is composed, it is easy to see that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passions engendered by property are keenest and most tenacious amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the middle classes. The poor often care but little for what they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possess, because they suffer much more from the want of what they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not, than they enjoy the little they have. The rich have many other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions besides that of riches to satisfy; and, besides, the long and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arduous enjoyment of a great fortune sometimes makes them in the end,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insensible to its charms. But the men who have a competency, alike","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"removed from opulence and from penury, attach an enormous value to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possessions. As they are still almost within the reach of poverty, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"see its privations near at hand, and dread them; between poverty and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves there is nothing but a scanty fortune, upon which they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,immediately fix their apprehensions and their hopes. Every day increases,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the interest they take in it, by the constant cares which it occasions;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and they are the more attached to it by their continual exertions to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increase the amount. The notion of surrendering the smallest part of it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is insupportable to them, and they consider its total loss as the worst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of misfortunes. Now these eager and apprehensive men of small property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constitute the class which is constantly increased by the equality of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions. Hence, in democratic communities, the majority of the people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"do not clearly see what they have to gain by a revolution, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,continually and in a thousand ways feel that they might lose by one.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have shown in another part of this work that the equality of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conditions naturally urges men to embark in commercial and industrial,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pursuits, and that it tends to increase and to distribute real property:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have also pointed out the means by which it inspires every man with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an eager and constant desire to increase his welfare. Nothing is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opposed to revolutionary passions than these things. It may happen,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the final result of a revolution is favorable to commerce and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures; but its first consequence will almost always be the ruin,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of manufactures and mercantile men, because it must always change at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"once the general principles of consumption, and temporarily upset the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,existing proportion between supply and demand. I know of nothing more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opposite to revolutionary manners than commercial manners. Commerce is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally adverse to all the violent passions; it loves to temporize,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"takes delight in compromise, and studiously avoids irritation. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is patient, insinuating, flexible, and never has recourse to extreme","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,measures until obliged by the most absolute necessity. Commerce renders,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men independent of each other, gives them a lofty notion of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"personal importance, leads them to seek to conduct their own affairs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and teaches how to conduct them well; it therefore prepares men for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freedom, but preserves them from revolutions. In a revolution the owners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of personal property have more to fear than all others; for on the one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand their property is often easy to seize, and on the other it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,totally disappear at any moment--a subject of alarm to which the owners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of real property are less exposed, since, although they may lose the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"income of their estates, they may hope to preserve the land itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,through the greatest vicissitudes. Hence the former are much more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,alarmed at the symptoms of revolutionary commotion than the latter. Thus,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations are less disposed to make revolutions in proportion as personal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"property is augmented and distributed amongst them, and as the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of those possessing it increases. Moreover, whatever profession men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may embrace, and whatever species of property they may possess, one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,characteristic is common to them all. No one is fully contented with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his present fortune--all are perpetually striving in a thousand ways to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"improve it. Consider any one of them at any period of his life, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he will be found engaged with some new project for the purpose of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increasing what he has; talk not to him of the interests and the rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of mankind: this small domestic concern absorbs for the time all his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"thoughts, and inclines him to defer political excitement to some other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"season. This not only prevents men from making revolutions, but deters","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men from desiring them. Violent political passions have but little hold,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on those who have devoted all their faculties to the pursuit of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well-being. The ardor which they display in small matters calms their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,zeal for momentous undertakings.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"From time to time indeed, enterprising and ambitious men will arise in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic communities, whose unbounded aspirations cannot be contented","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by following the beaten track. Such men like revolutions and hail their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"approach; but they have great difficulty in bringing them about, unless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unwonted events come to their assistance. No man can struggle with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advantage against the spirit of his age and country; and, however","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powerful he may be supposed to be, he will find it difficult to make his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemporaries share in feelings and opinions which are repugnant to t,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all their feelings and desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is a mistake to believe that, when once the equality of conditions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has become the old and uncontested state of society, and has imparted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its characteristics to the manners of a nation, men will easily allow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves to be thrust into perilous risks by an imprudent leader or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a bold innovator. Not indeed that they will resist him openly, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well-contrived schemes, or even by a premeditated plan of resistance.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"They will not struggle energetically against him, sometimes they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,even applaud him--but they do not follow him. To his vehemence they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secretly oppose their inertia; to his revolutionary tendencies their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conservative interests; their homely tastes to his adventurous passions;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their good sense to the flights of his genius; to his poetry their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prose. With immense exertion he raises them for an instant, but they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"speedily escape from him, and fall back, as it were, by their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weight. He strains himself to rouse the indifferent and distracted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"multitude, and finds at last that he is reduced to impotence, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"because he is conquered, but because he is alone.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not assert that men living in democratic communities are naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stationary; I think, on the contrary, that a perpetual stir prevails","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the bosom of those societies, and that rest is unknown there; but I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,think that men bestir themselves within certain limits beyond which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they hardly ever go. They are forever varying, altering, and restoring","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secondary matters; but they carefully abstain from touching what is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fundamental. They love change, but they dread revolutions. Although the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans are constantly modifying or abrogating some of their laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they by no means display revolutionary passions. It may be easily seen,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the promptitude with which they check and calm themselves when,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"public excitement begins to grow alarming, and at the very moment when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions seem most roused, that they dread a revolution as the worst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of misfortunes, and that every one of them is inwardly resolved to make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great sacrifices to avoid such a catastrophe. In no country in the world,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is the love of property more active and more anxious than in the United,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,States; nowhere does the majority display less inclination for those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principles which threaten to alter, in whatever manner, the laws","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of property. I have often remarked that theories which are of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutionary nature, since they cannot be put in practice without a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,complete and sometimes a sudden change in the state of property and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons, are much less favorably viewed in the United States than in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the great monarchical countries of Europe: if some men profess them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the bulk of the people reject them with instinctive abhorrence. I do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hesitate to say that most of the maxims commonly called democratic in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,France would be proscribed by the democracy of the United States. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may easily be understood: in America men have the opinions and passions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of democracy, in Europe we have still the passions and opinions of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolution. If ever America undergoes great revolutions, they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be brought about by the presence of the black race on the soil of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States--that is to say, they will owe their origin, not to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, but to the inequality, of conditions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When social conditions are equal, every man is apt to live apart,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,centred in himself and forgetful of the public. If the rulers of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations were either to neglect to correct this fatal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tendency, or to encourage it from a notion that it weans men from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"political passions and thus wards off revolutions, they might eventually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"produce the evil they seek to avoid, and a time might come when the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inordinate passions of a few men, aided by the unintelligent selfishness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or the pusillanimity of the greater number, would ultimately compel","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society to pass through strange vicissitudes. In democratic communities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolutions are seldom desired except by a minority; but a minority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may sometimes effect them. I do not assert that democratic nations are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,secure from revolutions; I merely say that the state of society in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those nations does not lead to revolutions, but rather wards them off.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A democratic people left to itself will not easily embark in great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hazards; it is only led to revolutions unawares; it may sometimes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undergo them, but it does not make them; and I will add that, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such a people has been allowed to acquire sufficient knowledge and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"experience, it will not suffer them to be made. I am well aware that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it this respect public institutions may themselves do much; they may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,encourage or repress the tendencies which originate in the state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society. I therefore do not maintain, I repeat, that a people is secure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from revolutions simply because conditions are equal in the community;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but I think that, whatever the institutions of such a people may be,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great revolutions will always be far less violent and less frequent than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is supposed; and I can easily discern a state of polity, which, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"combined with the principle of equality, would render society more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stationary than it has ever been in our western apart of the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The observations I have here made on events may also be applied in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,part to opinions. Two things are surprising in the United States--the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mutability of the greater part of human actions, and the singular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stability of certain principles. Men are in constant motion; the mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of man appears almost unmoved. When once an opinion has spread over the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country and struck root there, it would seem that no power on earth is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strong enough to eradicate it. In the United States, general principles","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in religion, philosophy, morality, and even politics, do not vary, or at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,least are only modified by a hidden and often an imperceptible process:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"even the grossest prejudices are obliterated with incredible slowness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amidst the continual friction of men and things. I hear it said that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is in the nature and the habits of democracies to be constantly changing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their opinions and feelings. This may be true of small democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, like those of the ancient world, in which the whole community","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,could be assembled in a public place and then excited at will by an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,orator. But I saw nothing of the kind amongst the great democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people which dwells upon the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,What struck me in the United States was the difficulty in shaking the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"majority in an opinion once conceived, or of drawing it off from a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leader once adopted. Neither speaking nor writing can accomplish it;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nothing but experience will avail, and even experience must be repeated.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This is surprising at first sight, but a more attentive investigation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,explains the fact. I do not think that it is as easy as is supposed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uproot the prejudices of a democratic people--to change its belief--to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supersede principles once established, by new principles in religion,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"politics, and morals--in a word, to make great and frequent changes in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men's minds. Not that the human mind is there at rest--it is in constant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,agitation; but it is engaged in infinitely varying the consequences of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"known principles, and in seeking for new consequences, rather than in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seeking for new principles. Its motion is one of rapid circumvolution,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rather than of straightforward impulse by rapid and direct effort; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extends its orbit by small continual and hasty movements, but it does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not suddenly alter its position.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Men who are equal in rights, in education, in fortune, or, to comprise","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all in one word, in their social condition, have necessarily wants,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits, and tastes which are hardly dissimilar. As they look at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"objects under the same aspect, their minds naturally tend to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"analogous conclusions; and, though each of them may deviate from his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemporaries and from opinions of his own, they will involuntarily and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unconsciously concur in a certain number of received opinions. The more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attentively I consider the effects of equality upon the mind, the more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,am I persuaded that the intellectual anarchy which we witness about us,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not, as many men suppose, the natural state of democratic nations.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think it is rather to be regarded as an accident peculiar to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"youth, and that it only breaks out at that period of transition when men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have already snapped the former ties which bound them together, but are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still amazingly different in origin, education, and manners; so that,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"having retained opinions, propensities and tastes of great diversity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing any longer prevents men from avowing them openly. The leading,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opinions of men become similar in proportion as their conditions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assimilate; such appears to me to be the general and permanent law--the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rest is casual and transient.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe that it will rarely happen to any man amongst a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, suddenly to frame a system of notions very remote from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that which his contemporaries have adopted; and if some such innovator,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appeared, I apprehend that he would have great difficulty in finding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"listeners, still more in finding believers. When the conditions of men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are almost equal, they do not easily allow themselves to be persuaded by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"each other. As they all live in close intercourse, as they have learned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the same things together, and as they lead the same life, they are not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally disposed to take one of themselves for a guide, and to follow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him implicitly. Men seldom take the opinion of their equal, or of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man like themselves, upon trust. Not only is confidence in the superior","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attainments of certain individuals weakened amongst democratic nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as I have elsewhere remarked, but the general notion of the intellectual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,superiority which any man whatsoever may acquire in relation to the rest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community is soon overshadowed. As men grow more like each other,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the doctrine of the equality of the intellect gradually infuses itself,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,into their opinions; and it becomes more difficult for any innovator to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acquire or to exert much influence over the minds of a people. In such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communities sudden intellectual revolutions will therefore be rare; for,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"if we read aright the history of the world, we shall find that great and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rapid changes in human opinions have been produced far less by the force,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of reasoning than by the authority of a name. Observe, too, that as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men who live in democratic societies are not connected with each other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by any tie, each of them must be convinced individually; whilst in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic society it is enough to convince a few--the rest follow.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If Luther had lived in an age of equality, and had not had princes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and potentates for his audience, he would perhaps have found it more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficult to change the aspect of Europe. Not indeed that the men of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracies are naturally strongly persuaded of the certainty of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions, or are unwavering in belief; they frequently entertain doubts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which no one, in their eyes, can remove. It sometimes happens at such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,times that the human mind would willingly change its position; but as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nothing urges or guides it forwards, it oscillates to and fro without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,progressive motion. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: If I inquire what state of society is most favorable to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great revolutions of the mind, I find that it occurs somewhere between","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the complete equality of the whole community and the absolute separation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of ranks. Under a system of castes generations succeed each other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without altering men's positions; some have nothing more, others nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"better, to hope for. The imagination slumbers amidst this universal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"silence and stillness, and the very idea of change fades from the human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind. When ranks have been abolished and social conditions are almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equalized, all men are in ceaseless excitement, but each of them stands","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alone, independent and weak. This latter state of things is excessively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different from the former one; yet it has one point of analogy--great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolutions of the human mind seldom occur in it. But between these two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extremes of the history of nations is an intermediate period--a period,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as glorious as it is agitated--when the conditions of men are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently settled for the mind to be lulled in torpor, when they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sufficiently unequal for men to exercise a vast power on the minds of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"one another, and when some few may modify the convictions of all. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at such times that great reformers start up, and new opinions suddenly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,change the face of the world.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Even when the reliance of a democratic people has been won, it is still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no easy matter to gain their attention. It is extremely difficult to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obtain a hearing from men living in democracies, unless it be to speak","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to them of themselves. They do not attend to the things said to them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because they are always fully engrossed with the things they are doing.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,For indeed few men are idle in democratic nations; life is passed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the midst of noise and excitement, and men are so engaged in acting that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,little remains to them for thinking. I would especially remark that they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are not only employed, but that they are passionately devoted to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"employments. They are always in action, and each of their actions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,absorbs their faculties: the zeal which they display in business puts,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,out the enthusiasm they might otherwise entertain for idea. I think,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that it is extremely difficult to excite the enthusiasm of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people for any theory which has not a palpable, direct, and immediate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,connection with the daily occupations of life: therefore they will not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,easily forsake their old opinions; for it is enthusiasm which flings the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"minds of men out of the beaten track, and effects the great revolutions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the intellect as well as the great revolutions of the political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,world. Thus democratic nations have neither time nor taste to go in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"search of novel opinions. Even when those they possess become doubtful,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they still retain them, because it would take too much time and inquiry","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to change them--they retain them, not as certain, but as established.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There are yet other and more cogent reasons which prevent any great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,change from being easily effected in the principles of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people. I have already adverted to them at the commencement of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,part of my work. If the influence of individuals is weak and hardly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perceptible amongst such a people, the power exercised by the mass upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the mind of each individual is extremely great--I have already shown for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what reasons. I would now observe that it is wrong to suppose that this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"depends solely upon the form of government, and that the majority would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lose its intellectual supremacy if it were to lose its political power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In aristocracies men have often much greatness and strength of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own: when they find themselves at variance with the greater number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their fellow-countrymen, they withdraw to their own circle, where they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,support and console themselves. Such is not the case in a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country; there public favor seems as necessary as the air we breathe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to live at variance with the multitude is, as it were, not to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,live. The multitude requires no laws to coerce those who think not like,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself: public disapprobation is enough; a sense of their loneliness and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,impotence overtakes them and drives them to despair.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Whenever social conditions are equal, public opinion presses with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enormous weight upon the mind of each individual; it surrounds, directs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and oppresses him; and this arises from the very constitution of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society, much more than from its political laws. As men grow more alike,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each man feels himself weaker in regard to all the rest; as he discerns,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nothing by which he is considerably raised above them, or distinguished","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from them, he mistrusts himself as soon as they assail him. Not only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"does he mistrust his strength, but he even doubts of his right; and he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is very near acknowledging that he is in the wrong, when the greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of his countrymen assert that he is so. The majority do not need,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to constrain him--they convince him. In whatever way then the powers of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic community may be organized and balanced, it will always be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extremely difficult to believe what the bulk of the people reject, or to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,profess what they condemn.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This circumstance is extraordinarily favorable to the stability of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions. When an opinion has taken root amongst a democratic people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and established itself in the minds of the bulk of the community, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afterwards subsists by itself and is maintained without effort, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no one attacks it. Those who at first rejected it as false, ultimately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,receive it as the general impression; and those who still dispute it in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their hearts, conceal their dissent; they are careful not to engage in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangerous and useless conflict. It is true, that when the majority of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people change their opinions, they may suddenly and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arbitrarily effect strange revolutions in men's minds; but their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions do not change without much difficulty, and it is almost as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficult to show that they are changed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Time, events, or the unaided individual action of the mind, will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes undermine or destroy an opinion, without any outward sign","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the change. It has not been openly assailed, no conspiracy has been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"formed to make war on it, but its followers one by one noiselessly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"secede--day by day a few of them abandon it, until last it is only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,professed by a minority. In this state it will still continue to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prevail. As its enemies remain mute, or only interchange their thoughts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by stealth, they are themselves unaware for a long period that a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolution has actually been effected; and in this state of uncertainly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they take no steps--they observe each other and are silent. The majority,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have ceased to believe what they believed before; but they still affect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to believe, and this empty phantom of public opinion in strong enough to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chill innovators, and to keep them silent and at respectful distance. We","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,live at a time which has witnessed the most rapid changes of opinion in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the minds of men; nevertheless it may be that the leading opinions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society will ere long be more settled than they have been for several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centuries in our history: that time is not yet come, but it may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perhaps be approaching. As I examine more closely the natural wants and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tendencies of democratic nations, I grow persuaded that if ever social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality is generally and permanently established in the world, great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intellectual and political revolutions will become more difficult and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less frequent than is supposed. Because the men of democracies appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always excited, uncertain, eager, changeable in their wills and in their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"positions, it is imagined that they are suddenly to abrogate their laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to adopt new opinions, and to assume new manners. But if the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of equality predisposes men to change, it also suggests to them certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interests and tastes which cannot be satisfied without a settled order,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of things; equality urges them on, but at the same time it holds them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"back; it spurs them, but fastens them to earth;--it kindles their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desires, but limits their powers. This, however, is not perceived at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,first; the passions which tend to sever the citizens of a democracy are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obvious enough; but the hidden force which restrains and unites them is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not discernible at a glance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amidst the ruins which surround me, shall I dare to say that revolutions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are not what I most fear coming generations? If men continue to shut,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves more closely within the narrow circle of domestic interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and to live upon that kind of excitement, it is to be apprehended that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they may ultimately become inaccessible to those great and powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public emotions which perturb nations--but which enlarge them and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"recruit them. When property becomes so fluctuating, and the love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"property so restless and so ardent, I cannot but fear that men may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"arrive at such a state as to regard every new theory as a peril,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every innovation as an irksome toil, every social improvement as a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stepping-stone to revolution, and so refuse to move altogether for fear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of being moved too far. I dread, and I confess it, lest they should at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"last so entirely give way to a cowardly love of present enjoyment, as to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lose sight of the interests of their future selves and of those of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"descendants; and to prefer to glide along the easy current of life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rather than to make, when it is necessary, a strong and sudden effort","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to a higher purpose. It is believed by some that modern society will be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ever changing its aspect; for myself, I fear that it will ultimately be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"too invariably fixed in the same institutions, the same prejudices, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same manners, so that mankind will be stopped and circumscribed; that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the mind will swing backwards and forwards forever, without begetting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fresh ideas; that man will waste his strength in bootless and solitary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trifling; and, though in continual motion, that humanity will cease to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advance.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,And Democratic Armies Of War,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The same interests, the same fears, the same passions which deter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations from revolutions, deter them also from war; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spirit of military glory and the spirit of revolution are weakened at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same time and by the same causes. The ever-increasing numbers of men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of property--lovers of peace, the growth of personal wealth which war","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"so rapidly consumes, the mildness of manners, the gentleness of heart,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those tendencies to pity which are engendered by the equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conditions, that coolness of understanding which renders men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,comparatively insensible to the violent and poetical excitement of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arms--all these causes concur to quench the military spirit. I think it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may be admitted as a general and constant rule, that, amongst civilized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, the warlike passions will become more rare and less intense in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proportion as social conditions shall be more equal. War is nevertheless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an occurrence to which all nations are subject, democratic nations as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"well as others. Whatever taste they may have for peace, they must hold","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves in readiness to repel aggression, or in other words they must","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have an army.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Fortune, which has conferred so many peculiar benefits upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inhabitants of the United States, has placed them in the midst of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wilderness, where they have, so to speak, no neighbors: a few thousand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,soldiers are sufficient for their wants; but this is peculiar to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America, not to democracy. The equality of conditions, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners as well as the institutions resulting from it, do not exempt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people from the necessity of standing armies, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,armies always exercise a powerful influence over their fate. It is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore of singular importance to inquire what are the natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,propensities of the men of whom these armies are composed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst aristocratic nations, especially amongst those in which birth","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is the only source of rank, the same inequality exists in the army as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the nation; the officer is noble, the soldier is a serf; the one is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally called upon to command, the other to obey. In aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"armies, the private soldier's ambition is therefore circumscribed within","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very narrow limits. Nor has the ambition of the officer an unlimited,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,range. An aristocratic body not only forms a part of the scale of ranks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the nation, but it contains a scale of ranks within itself: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of whom it is composed are placed one above another, in a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,particular and unvarying manner. Thus one man is born to the command of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a regiment, another to that of a company; when once they have reached","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the utmost object of their hopes, they stop of their own accord, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remain contented with their lot. There is, besides, a strong cause,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which, in aristocracies, weakens the officer's desire of promotion.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst aristocratic nations, an officer, independently of his rank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the army, also occupies an elevated rank in society; the former is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost always in his eyes only an appendage to the latter. A nobleman,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who embraces the profession of arms follows it less from motives of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ambition than from a sense of the duties imposed on him by his birth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,He enters the army in order to find an honorable employment for the idle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"years of his youth, and to be able to bring back to his home and his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peers some honorable recollections of military life; but his principal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object is not to obtain by that profession either property, distinction,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or power, for he possesses these advantages in his own right, and enjoys","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them without leaving his home.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In democratic armies all the soldiers may become officers, which makes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the desire of promotion general, and immeasurably extends the bounds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of military ambition. The officer, on his part, sees nothing which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,naturally and necessarily stops him at one grade more than at another;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and each grade has immense importance in his eyes, because his rank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in society almost always depends on his rank in the army. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations it often happens that an officer has no property but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his pay, and no distinction but that of military honors: consequently as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"often as his duties change, his fortune changes, and he becomes, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it were, a new man. What was only an appendage to his position in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic armies, has thus become the main point, the basis of his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whole condition. Under the old French monarchy officers were always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,called by their titles of nobility; they are now always called by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the title of their military rank. This little change in the forms of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,language suffices to show that a great revolution has taken place in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constitution of society and in that of the army. In democratic armies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the desire of advancement is almost universal: it is ardent,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tenacious, perpetual; it is strengthened by all other desires, and only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extinguished with life itself. But it is easy to see, that of all armies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the world, those in which advancement must be slowest in time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of peace are the armies of democratic countries. As the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commissions is naturally limited, whilst the number of competitors is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost unlimited, and as the strict law of equality is over all alike,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,none can make rapid progress--many can make no progress at all. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desire of advancement is greater, and the opportunities of advancement","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fewer, there than elsewhere. All the ambitious spirits of a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"army are consequently ardently desirous of war, because war makes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"vacancies, and warrants the violation of that law of seniority which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sole privilege natural to democracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"We thus arrive at this singular consequence, that of all armies those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most ardently desirous of war are democratic armies, and of all nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those most fond of peace are democratic nations: and, what makes these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"facts still more extraordinary, is that these contrary effects are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,produced at the same time by the principle of equality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"All the members of the community, being alike, constantly harbor the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wish, and discover the possibility, of changing their condition and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"improving their welfare: this makes them fond of peace, which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"favorable to industry, and allows every man to pursue his own little","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertakings to their completion. On the other hand, this same equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"makes soldiers dream of fields of battle, by increasing the value of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"military honors in the eyes of those who follow the profession of arms,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and by rendering those honors accessible to all. In either case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the inquietude of the heart is the same, the taste for enjoyment as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insatiable, the ambition of success as great--the means of gratifying it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are alone different.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These opposite tendencies of the nation and the army expose democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communities to great dangers. When a military spirit forsakes a people,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the profession of arms immediately ceases to be held in honor, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,military men fall to the lowest rank of the public servants: they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"little esteemed, and no longer understood. The reverse of what takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,place in aristocratic ages then occurs; the men who enter the army,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are no longer those of the highest, but of the lowest rank. Military","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ambition is only indulged in when no other is possible. Hence arises a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,circle of cause and consequence from which it is difficult to escape:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the best part of the nation shuns the military profession because that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"profession is not honored, and the profession is not honored because the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,best part of the nation has ceased to follow it. It is then no matter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of surprise that democratic armies are often restless, ill-tempered,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and dissatisfied with their lot, although their physical condition is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commonly far better, and their discipline less strict than in other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"countries. The soldier feels that he occupies an inferior position,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and his wounded pride either stimulates his taste for hostilities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which would render his services necessary, or gives him a turn for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutions, during which he may hope to win by force of arms the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political influence and personal importance now denied him. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,composition of democratic armies makes this last-mentioned danger,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much to be feared. In democratic communities almost every man has some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,property to preserve; but democratic armies are generally led by men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without property, most of whom have little to lose in civil broils. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bulk of the nation is naturally much more afraid of revolutions than in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the ages of aristocracy, but the leaders of the army much less so.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Moreover, as amongst democratic nations (to repeat what I have just","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remarked) the wealthiest, the best educated, and the most able men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seldom adopt the military profession, the army, taken collectively,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eventually forms a small nation by itself, where the mind is less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enlarged, and habits are more rude than in the nation at large. Now,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this small uncivilized nation has arms in its possession, and alone","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knows how to use them: for, indeed, the pacific temper of the community","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increases the danger to which a democratic people is exposed from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,military and turbulent spirit of the army. Nothing is so dangerous as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an army amidst an unwarlike nation; the excessive love of the whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community for quiet continually puts its constitution at the mercy of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the soldiery. It may therefore be asserted, generally speaking, that if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations are naturally prone to peace from their interests and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their propensities, they are constantly drawn to war and revolutions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by their armies. Military revolutions, which are scarcely ever to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be apprehended in aristocracies, are always to be dreaded amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations. These perils must be reckoned amongst the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"formidable which beset their future fate, and the attention of statesmen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,should be sedulously applied to find a remedy for the evil.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,When a nation perceives that it is inwardly affected by the restless,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ambition of its army, the first thought which occurs is to give this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inconvenient ambition an object by going to war. I speak no ill of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"war: war almost always enlarges the mind of a people, and raises their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,character. In some cases it is the only check to the excessive growth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of certain propensities which naturally spring out of the equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of conditions, and it must be considered as a necessary corrective to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain inveterate diseases to which democratic communities are liable.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"War has great advantages, but we must not flatter ourselves that it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can diminish the danger I have just pointed out. That peril is only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"suspended by it, to return more fiercely when the war is over; for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,armies are much more impatient of peace after having tasted military,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exploits. War could only be a remedy for a people which should always be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,athirst for military glory. I foresee that all the military rulers who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may rise up in great democratic nations, will find it easier to conquer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with their armies, than to make their armies live at peace after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conquest. There are two things which a democratic people will always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"find very difficult--to begin a war, and to end it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Again, if war has some peculiar advantages for democratic nations, on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the other hand it exposes them to certain dangers which aristocracies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have no cause to dread to an equal extent. I shall only point out two,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of these. Although war gratifies the army, it embarrasses and often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exasperates that countless multitude of men whose minor passions every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,day require peace in order to be satisfied. Thus there is some risk,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of its causing, under another form, the disturbance it is intended","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to prevent. No protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic country. Not indeed that after every victory it is to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,apprehended that the victorious generals will possess themselves by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"force of the supreme power, after the manner of Sylla and Caesar: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,danger is of another kind. War does not always give over democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communities to military government, but it must invariably and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,immeasurably increase the powers of civil government; it must almost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,compulsorily concentrate the direction of all men and the management,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of all things in the hands of the administration. If it lead not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"despotism by sudden violence, it prepares men for it more gently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by their habits. All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nation ought to know that war is the surest and the shortest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,means to accomplish it. This is the first axiom of the science.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"One remedy, which appears to be obvious when the ambition of soldiers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and officers becomes the subject of alarm, is to augment the number","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of commissions to be distributed by increasing the army. This affords,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"temporary relief, but it plunges the country into deeper difficulties at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,some future period. To increase the army may produce a lasting effect in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an aristocratic community, because military ambition is there confined","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to one class of men, and the ambition of each individual stops, as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were, at a certain limit; so that it may be possible to satisfy all who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feel its influence. But nothing is gained by increasing the army amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people, because the number of aspirants always rises in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exactly the same ratio as the army itself. Those whose claims have been,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,satisfied by the creation of new commissions are instantly succeeded by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a fresh multitude beyond all power of satisfaction; and even those who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were but now satisfied soon begin to crave more advancement; for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same excitement prevails in the ranks of the army as in the civil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"classes of democratic society, and what men want is not to reach a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"certain grade, but to have constant promotion. Though these wants may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not be very vast, they are perpetually recurring. Thus a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation, by augmenting its army, only allays for a time the ambition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the military profession, which soon becomes even more formidable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because the number of those who feel it is increased. I am of opinion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that a restless and turbulent spirit is an evil inherent in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very constitution of democratic armies, and beyond hope of cure. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,legislators of democracies must not expect to devise any military,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,organization capable by its influence of calming and restraining the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"military profession: their efforts would exhaust their powers, before","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the object is attained.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The remedy for the vices of the army is not to be found in the army,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"itself, but in the country. Democratic nations are naturally afraid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of disturbance and of despotism; the object is to turn these natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instincts into well-digested, deliberate, and lasting tastes. When men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have at last learned to make a peaceful and profitable use of freedom,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and have felt its blessings--when they have conceived a manly love of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order, and have freely submitted themselves to discipline--these same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, if they follow the profession of arms, bring into it, unconsciously","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and almost against their will, these same habits and manners. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general spirit of the nation being infused into the spirit peculiar to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the army, tempers the opinions and desires engendered by military life,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or represses them by the mighty force of public opinion. Teach but the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"citizens to be educated, orderly, firm, and free, the soldiers will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disciplined and obedient. Any law which, in repressing the turbulent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirit of the army, should tend to diminish the spirit of freedom in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation, and to overshadow the notion of law and right, would defeat","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its object: it would do much more to favor, than to defeat, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,establishment of military tyranny.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"After all, and in spite of all precautions, a large army amidst a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic people will always be a source of great danger; the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"effectual means of diminishing that danger would be to reduce the army,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but this is a remedy which all nations have it not in their power to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,use.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XXIII: Which Is The Most Warlike And Most Revolutionary Class In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic Armies?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is a part of the essence of a democratic army to be very numerous in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proportion to the people to which it belongs, as I shall hereafter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"show. On the other hand, men living in democratic times seldom choose a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,military life. Democratic nations are therefore soon led to give up the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,system of voluntary recruiting for that of compulsory enlistment. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessity of their social condition compels them to resort to the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"means, and it may easily be foreseen that they will all eventually adopt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. When military service is compulsory, the burden is indiscriminately","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and equally borne by the whole community. This is another necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence of the social condition of these nations, and of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notions. The government may do almost whatever it pleases, provided it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,appeals to the whole community at once: it is the unequal distribution,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the weight, not the weight itself, which commonly occasions","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resistance. But as military service is common to all the citizens, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,evident consequence is that each of them remains but for a few years,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on active duty. Thus it is in the nature of things that the soldier in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies only passes through the army, whilst among most aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations the military profession is one which the soldier adopts, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which is imposed upon him, for life.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This has important consequences. Amongst the soldiers of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"army, some acquire a taste for military life, but the majority, being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enlisted against their will, and ever ready to go back to their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"homes, do not consider themselves as seriously engaged in the military","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"profession, and are always thinking of quitting it. Such men do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contract the wants, and only half partake in the passions, which that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mode of life engenders. They adapt themselves to their military duties,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but their minds are still attached to the interests and the duties which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engaged them in civil life. They do not therefore imbibe the spirit of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the army--or rather, they infuse the spirit of the community at large","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into the army, and retain it there. Amongst democratic nations the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private soldiers remain most like civilians: upon them the habits of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation have the firmest hold, and public opinion most influence. It is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the instrumentality of the private soldiers especially that it may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be possible to infuse into a democratic army the love of freedom and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the respect of rights, if these principles have once been successfully","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inculcated on the people at large. The reverse happens amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic nations, where the soldiery have eventually nothing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"common with their fellow-citizens, and where they live amongst them as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strangers, and often as enemies. In aristocratic armies the officers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are the conservative element, because the officers alone have retained a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strict connection with civil society, and never forego their purpose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of resuming their place in it sooner or later: in democratic armies the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private soldiers stand in this position, and from the same cause.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It often happens, on the contrary, that in these same democratic armies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the officers contract tastes and wants wholly distinct from those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the nation--a fact which may be thus accounted for. Amongst democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations, the man who becomes an officer severs all the ties which bound","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him to civil life; he leaves it forever; he has no interest to resume,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. His true country is the army, since he owes all he has to the rank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he has attained in it; he therefore follows the fortunes of the army,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rises or sinks with it, and henceforward directs all his hopes to that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,quarter only. As the wants of an officer are distinct from those of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country, he may perhaps ardently desire war, or labor to bring about","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a revolution at the very moment when the nation is most desirous of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stability and peace. There are, nevertheless, some causes which allay","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this restless and warlike spirit. Though ambition is universal and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"continual amongst democratic nations, we have seen that it is seldom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great. A man who, being born in the lower classes of the community, has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"risen from the ranks to be an officer, has already taken a prodigious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,step. He has gained a footing in a sphere above that which he filled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in civil life, and he has acquired rights which most democratic nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will ever consider as inalienable. *a He is willing to pause after so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great an effort, and to enjoy what he has won. The fear of risking what","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he has already obtained damps the desire of acquiring what he has not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,got. Having conquered the first and greatest impediment which opposed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his advancement, he resigns himself with less impatience to the slowness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his progress. His ambition will be more and more cooled in proportion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as the increasing distinction of his rank teaches him that he has more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to put in jeopardy. If I am not mistaken, the least warlike, and also","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the least revolutionary part, of a democratic army, will always be its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,chief commanders. [Footnote a: The position of officers is indeed much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more secure amongst democratic nations than elsewhere; the lower the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"personal standing of the man, the greater is the comparative importance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his military grade, and the more just and necessary is it that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enjoyment of that rank should be secured by the laws.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But the remarks I have just made on officers and soldiers are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not applicable to a numerous class which in all armies fills the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intermediate space between them--I mean the class of non-commissioned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,officers. This class of non-commissioned officers which have never acted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a part in history until the present century, is henceforward destined,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I think, to play one of some importance. Like the officers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"non-commissioned officers have broken, in their minds, all the ties","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which bound them to civil life; like the former, they devote themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"permanently to the service, and perhaps make it even more exclusively","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the object of all their desires: but non-commissioned officers are men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who have not yet reached a firm and lofty post at which they may pause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and breathe more freely, ere they can attain further promotion. By","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the very nature of his duties, which is invariable, a non-commissioned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officer is doomed to lead an obscure, confined, comfortless, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,precarious existence; as yet he sees nothing of military life but its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dangers; he knows nothing but its privations and its discipline--more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,difficult to support than dangers: he suffers the more from his present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"miseries, from knowing that the constitution of society and of the army","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"allow him to rise above them; he may, indeed, at any time obtain his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commission, and enter at once upon command, honors, independence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rights, and enjoyments. Not only does this object of his hopes appear to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him of immense importance, but he is never sure of reaching it till it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is actually his own; the grade he fills is by no means irrevocable; he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is always entirely abandoned to the arbitrary pleasure of his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commanding officer, for this is imperiously required by the necessity of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discipline: a slight fault, a whim, may always deprive him in an instant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the fruits of many years of toil and endeavor; until he has reached,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the grade to which he aspires he has accomplished nothing; not till he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reaches that grade does his career seem to begin. A desperate ambition,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot fail to be kindled in a man thus incessantly goaded on by his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"youth, his wants, his passions, the spirit of his age, his hopes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and his age, his hopes, and his fears. Non-commissioned officers are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore bent on war--on war always, and at any cost; but if war be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"denied them, then they desire revolutions to suspend the authority","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of established regulations, and to enable them, aided by the general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confusion and the political passions of the time, to get rid of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,superior officers and to take their places. Nor is it impossible for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them to bring about such a crisis, because their common origin and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits give them much influence over the soldiers, however different may","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be their passions and their desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It would be an error to suppose that these various characteristics of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, belong to any particular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time or country; they will always occur at all times, and amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all democratic nations. In every democratic army the non-commissioned,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,officers will be the worst representatives of the pacific and orderly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirit of the country, and the private soldiers will be the best. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,latter will carry with them into military life the strength or weakness,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the manners of the nation; they will display a faithful reflection of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the community: if that community is ignorant and weak, they will allow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves to be drawn by their leaders into disturbances, either","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unconsciously or against their will; if it is enlightened and energetic,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the community will itself keep them within the bounds of order.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"Armies At The Outset Of A Campaign, And More Formidable In Protracted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Warfare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Any army is in danger of being conquered at the outset of a campaign,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,after a long peace; any army which has long been engaged in warfare,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has strong chances of victory: this truth is peculiarly applicable to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic armies. In aristocracies the military profession, being a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privileged career, is held in honor even in time of peace. Men of great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"talents, great attainments, and great ambition embrace it; the army is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in all respects on a level with the nation, and frequently above it. We","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have seen, on the contrary, that amongst a democratic people the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,choicer minds of the nation are gradually drawn away from the military,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"profession, to seek by other paths, distinction, power, and especially","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wealth. After a long peace--and in democratic ages the periods of peace,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are long--the army is always inferior to the country itself. In this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"state it is called into active service; and until war has altered it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there is danger for the country as well as for the army.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have shown that in democratic armies, and in time of peace, the rule","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of seniority is the supreme and inflexible law of advancement. This is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not only a consequence, as I have before observed, of the constitution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of these armies, but of the constitution of the people, and it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always occur. Again, as amongst these nations the officer derives his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"position in the country solely from his position in the army, and as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he draws all the distinction and the competency he enjoys from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same source, he does not retire from his profession, or is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"super-annuated, till towards the extreme close of life. The consequence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of these two causes is, that when a democratic people goes to war after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a long interval of peace all the leading officers of the army are old,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men. I speak not only of the generals, but of the non-commissioned","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officers, who have most of them been stationary, or have only advanced","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"step by step. It may be remarked with surprise, that in a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"army after a long peace all the soldiers are mere boys, and all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,superior officers in declining years; so that the former are wanting in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"experience, the latter in vigor. This is a strong element of defeat,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for the first condition of successful generalship is youth: I should not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have ventured to say so if the greatest captain of modern times had not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,made the observation. These two causes do not act in the same manner,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon aristocratic armies: as men are promoted in them by right of birth,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much more than by right of seniority, there are in all ranks a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"number of young men, who bring to their profession all the early vigor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of body and mind. Again, as the men who seek for military honors amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an aristocratic people, enjoy a settled position in civil society, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seldom continue in the army until old age overtakes them. After having,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"devoted the most vigorous years of youth to the career of arms, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"voluntarily retire, and spend at home the remainder of their maturer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,years.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A long peace not only fills democratic armies with elderly officers,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it also gives to all the officers habits both of body and mind which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,render them unfit for actual service. The man who has long lived amidst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the calm and lukewarm atmosphere of democratic manners can at first ill,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adapt himself to the harder toils and sterner duties of warfare; and if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he has not absolutely lost the taste for arms, at least he has assumed a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mode of life which unfits him for conquest.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Amongst aristocratic nations, the ease of civil life exercises less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influence on the manners of the army, because amongst those nations the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy commands the army: and an aristocracy, however plunged in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"luxurious pleasures, has always many other passions besides that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its own well-being, and to satisfy those passions more thoroughly its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well-being will be readily sacrificed. *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: See Appendix V.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have shown that in democratic armies, in time of peace, promotion is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extremely slow. The officers at first support this state of things with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impatience, they grow excited, restless, exasperated, but in the end","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most of them make up their minds to it. Those who have the largest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"share of ambition and of resources quit the army; others, adapting their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tastes and their desires to their scanty fortunes, ultimately look upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the military profession in a civil point of view. The quality they value,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most in it is the competency and security which attend it: their whole,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notion of the future rests upon the certainty of this little provision,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and all they require is peaceably to enjoy it. Thus not only does a long,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peace fill an army with old men, but it is frequently imparts the views","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of old men to those who are still in the prime of life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have also shown that amongst democratic nations in time of peace the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,military profession is held in little honor and indifferently followed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This want of public favor is a heavy discouragement to the army; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"weighs down the minds of the troops, and when war breaks out at last,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they cannot immediately resume their spring and vigor. No similar cause,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of moral weakness occurs in aristocratic armies: there the officers are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"never lowered either in their own eyes or in those of their countrymen,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"because, independently of their military greatness, they are personally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great. But even if the influence of peace operated on the two kinds of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"armies in the same manner, the results would still be different. When","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the officers of an aristocratic army have lost their warlike spirit and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the desire of raising themselves by service, they still retain a certain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respect for the honor of their class, and an old habit of being foremost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to set an example. But when the officers of a democratic army have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no longer the love of war and the ambition of arms, nothing whatever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remains to them.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am therefore of opinion that, when a democratic people engages in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a war after a long peace, it incurs much more risk of defeat than any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other nation; but it ought not easily to be cast down by its reverses,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for the chances of success for such an army are increased by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"duration of the war. When a war has at length, by its long continuance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,roused the whole community from their peaceful occupations and ruined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their minor undertakings, the same passions which made them attach so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much importance to the maintenance of peace will be turned to arms.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"War, after it has destroyed all modes of speculation, becomes itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the great and sole speculation, to which all the ardent and ambitious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,desires which equality engenders are exclusively directed. Hence it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the selfsame democratic nations which are so reluctant to engage,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in hostilities, sometimes perform prodigious achievements when once","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they have taken the field. As the war attracts more and more of public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attention, and is seen to create high reputations and great fortunes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in a short space of time, the choicest spirits of the nation enter the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"military profession: all the enterprising, proud, and martial minds, no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"longer of the aristocracy solely, but of the whole country, are drawn","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in this direction. As the number of competitors for military honors is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immense, and war drives every man to his proper level, great generals","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are always sure to spring up. A long war produces upon a democratic army,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same effects that a revolution produces upon a people; it breaks,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"through regulations, and allows extraordinary men to rise above the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common level. Those officers whose bodies and minds have grown old in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peace, are removed, or superannuated, or they die. In their stead a host","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of young men are pressing on, whose frames are already hardened, whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,desires are extended and inflamed by active service. They are bent on,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advancement at all hazards, and perpetual advancement; they are followed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by others with the same passions and desires, and after these are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,others yet unlimited by aught but the size of the army. The principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality opens the door of ambition to all, and death provides chances","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for ambition. Death is constantly thinning the ranks, making vacancies,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,closing and opening the career of arms.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,There is moreover a secret connection between the military character,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the character of democracies, which war brings to light. The men of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democracies are naturally passionately eager to acquire what they covet,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to enjoy it on easy conditions. They for the most part worship,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"chance, and are much less afraid of death than of difficulty. This is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the spirit which they bring to commerce and manufactures; and this same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirit, carried with them to the field of battle, induces them willingly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to expose their lives in order to secure in a moment the rewards of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,victory. No kind of greatness is more pleasing to the imagination of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a democratic people than military greatness--a greatness of vivid and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sudden lustre, obtained without toil, by nothing but the risk of life.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, whilst the interests and the tastes of the members of a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community divert them from war, their habits of mind fit them for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"carrying on war well; they soon make good soldiers, when they are roused","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from their business and their enjoyments. If peace is peculiarly hurtful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to democratic armies, war secures to them advantages which no other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"armies ever possess; and these advantages, however little felt at first,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot fail in the end to give them the victory. An aristocratic nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which in a contest with a democratic people does not succeed in ruining,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the latter at the outset of the war, always runs a great risk of being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conquered by it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XXV: Of Discipline In Democratic Armies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It is a very general opinion, especially in aristocratic countries,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the great social equality which prevails in democracies ultimately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"renders the private soldier independent of the officer, and thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"destroys the bond of discipline. This is a mistake, for there are two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kinds of discipline, which it is important not to confound. When the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officer is noble and the soldier a serf--one rich, the other poor--the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"former educated and strong, the latter ignorant and weak--the strictest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bond of obedience may easily be established between the two men. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soldier is broken in to military discipline, as it were, before he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enters the army; or rather, military discipline is nothing but an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enhancement of social servitude. In aristocratic armies the soldier,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will soon become insensible to everything but the orders of his superior,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officers; he acts without reflection, triumphs without enthusiasm, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dies without complaint: in this state he is no longer a man, but he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,still a most formidable animal trained for war.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,A democratic people must despair of ever obtaining from soldiers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that blind, minute, submissive, and invariable obedience which an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic people may impose on them without difficulty. The state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society does not prepare them for it, and the nation might be in danger","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of losing its natural advantages if it sought artificially to acquire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advantages of this particular kind. Amongst democratic communities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,military discipline ought not to attempt to annihilate the free spring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the faculties; all that can be done by discipline is to direct it;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the obedience thus inculcated is less exact, but it is more eager and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more intelligent. It has its root in the will of him who obeys: it rests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not only on his instinct, but on his reason; and consequently it will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,often spontaneously become more strict as danger requires it. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"discipline of an aristocratic army is apt to be relaxed in war, because","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that discipline is founded upon habits, and war disturbs those habits.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The discipline of a democratic army on the contrary is strengthened in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sight of the enemy, because every soldier then clearly perceives that he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must be silent and obedient in order to conquer.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The nations which have performed the greatest warlike achievements knew,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no other discipline than that which I speak of. Amongst the ancients,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"none were admitted into the armies but freemen and citizens, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"differed but little from one another, and were accustomed to treat","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other as equals. In this respect it may be said that the armies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of antiquity were democratic, although they came out of the bosom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of aristocracy; the consequence was that in those armies a sort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fraternal familiarity prevailed between the officers and the men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Plutarch's lives of great commanders furnish convincing instances of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fact: the soldiers were in the constant habit of freely addressing their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general, and the general listened to and answered whatever the soldiers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had to say: they were kept in order by language and by example, far","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more than by constraint or punishment; the general was as much their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,companion as their chief. I know not whether the soldiers of Greece and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Rome ever carried the minutiae of military discipline to the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,degree of perfection as the Russians have done; but this did not prevent,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Alexander from conquering Asia--and Rome, the world.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter XXVI: Some Considerations On War In Democratic Communities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When the principle of equality is in growth, not only amongst a single","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation, but amongst several neighboring nations at the same time, as is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"now the case in Europe, the inhabitants of these different countries,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notwithstanding the dissimilarity of language, of customs, and of laws,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nevertheless resemble each other in their equal dread of war and their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,common love of peace. *a It is in vain that ambition or anger puts arms,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the hands of princes; they are appeased in spite of themselves by a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"species of general apathy and goodwill, which makes the sword drop","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from their grasp, and wars become more rare. As the spread of equality,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"taking place in several countries at once, simultaneously impels their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"various inhabitants to follow manufactures and commerce, not only do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their tastes grow alike, but their interests are so mixed and entangled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with one another that no nation can inflict evils on other nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without those evils falling back upon itself; and all nations ultimately,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regard war as a calamity, almost as severe to the conqueror as to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the conquered. Thus, on the one hand, it is extremely difficult in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages to draw nations into hostilities; but on the other hand,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is almost impossible that any two of them should go to war without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"embroiling the rest. The interests of all are so interlaced, their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions and their wants so much alike, that none can remain quiet when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the others stir. Wars therefore become more rare, but when they break","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,out they spread over a larger field. Neighboring democratic nations not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only become alike in some respects, but they eventually grow to resemble","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each other in almost all. *b This similitude of nations has consequences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of great importance in relation to war.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that the dread,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of war displayed by the nations of Europe is not solely attributable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the progress made by the principle of equality amongst them;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independently of this permanent cause several other accidental causes of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great weight might be pointed out, and I may mention before all the rest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the extreme lassitude which the wars of the Revolution and the Empire,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have left behind them.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote b: This is not only because these nations have the same social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition, but it arises from the very nature of that social condition","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which leads men to imitate and identify themselves with each other. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the members of a community are divided into castes and classes, they not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only differ from one another, but they have no taste and no desire to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike; on the contrary, everyone endeavors, more and more, to keep his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own opinions undisturbed, to retain his own peculiar habits, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remain himself. The characteristics of individuals are very strongly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,marked. When the state of society amongst a people is democratic--that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is to say, when there are no longer any castes or classes in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, and all its members are nearly equal in education and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,property--the human mind follows the opposite direction. Men are much,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike, and they are annoyed, as it were, by any deviation from that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,likeness: far from seeking to preserve their own distinguishing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"singularities, they endeavor to shake them off, in order to identify","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves with the general mass of the people, which is the sole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,representative of right and of might to their eyes. The characteristics,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of individuals are nearly obliterated. In the ages of aristocracy even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those who are naturally alike strive to create imaginary differences,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,between themselves: in the ages of democracy even those who are not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike seek only to become so, and to copy each other--so strongly is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mind of every man always carried away by the general impulse of mankind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Something of the same kind may be observed between nations: two nations,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"having the same aristocratic social condition, might remain thoroughly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"distinct and extremely different, because the spirit of aristocracy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is to retain strong individual characteristics; but if two neighboring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations have the same democratic social condition, they cannot fail","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to adopt similar opinions and manners, because the spirit of democracy","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tends to assimilate men to each other.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If I inquire why it is that the Helvetic Confederacy made the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and most powerful nations of Europe tremble in the fifteenth century,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,whilst at the present day the power of that country is exactly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proportioned to its population, I perceive that the Swiss are become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"like all the surrounding communities, and those surrounding communities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,like the Swiss: so that as numerical strength now forms the only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difference between them, victory necessarily attends the largest army.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Thus one of the consequences of the democratic revolution which is going,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on in Europe is to make numerical strength preponderate on all fields,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of battle, and to constrain all small nations to incorporate themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with large States, or at least to adopt the policy of the latter. As","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"numbers are the determining cause of victory, each people ought of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,course to strive by all the means in its power to bring the greatest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,possible number of men into the field. When it was possible to enlist a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kind of troops superior to all others, such as the Swiss infantry or the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"French horse of the sixteenth century, it was not thought necessary to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,raise very large armies; but the case is altered when one soldier is as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,efficient as another.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The same cause which begets this new want also supplies means of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"satisfying it; for, as I have already observed, when men are all alike,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are all weak, and the supreme power of the State is naturally much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stronger amongst democratic nations than elsewhere. Hence, whilst these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations are desirous of enrolling the whole male population in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ranks of the army, they have the power of effecting this object: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence is, that in democratic ages armies seem to grow larger","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in proportion as the love of war declines. In the same ages, too,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the manner of carrying on war is likewise altered by the same causes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Machiavelli observes in ""The Prince,"" ""that it is much more difficult to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subdue a people which has a prince and his barons for its leaders,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than a nation which is commanded by a prince and his slaves."" To avoid","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"offence, let us read public functionaries for slaves, and this important","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,truth will be strictly applicable to our own time.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"A great aristocratic people cannot either conquer its neighbors, or be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conquered by them, without great difficulty. It cannot conquer them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because all its forces can never be collected and held together for a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"considerable period: it cannot be conquered, because an enemy meets at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,every step small centres of resistance by which invasion is arrested.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,War against an aristocracy may be compared to war in a mountainous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country; the defeated party has constant opportunities of rallying its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forces to make a stand in a new position. Exactly the reverse occurs,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst democratic nations: they easily bring their whole disposable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"force into the field, and when the nation is wealthy and populous it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soon becomes victorious; but if ever it is conquered, and its territory","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"invaded, it has few resources at command; and if the enemy takes the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"capital, the nation is lost. This may very well be explained: as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each member of the community is individually isolated and extremely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powerless, no one of the whole body can either defend himself or present","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a rallying point to others. Nothing is strong in a democratic country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,except the State; as the military strength of the State is destroyed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the destruction of the army, and its civil power paralyzed by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"capture of the chief city, all that remains is only a multitude without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength or government, unable to resist the organized power by which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is assailed. I am aware that this danger may be lessened by the creation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of provincial liberties, and consequently of provincial powers, but this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remedy will always be insufficient. For after such a catastrophe, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only is the population unable to carry on hostilities, but it may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,apprehended that they will not be inclined to attempt it. In accordance,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with the law of nations adopted in civilized countries, the object of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wars is not to seize the property of private individuals, but simply to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,get possession of political power. The destruction of private property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is only occasionally resorted to for the purpose of attaining the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,object. When an aristocratic country is invaded after the defeat of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its army, the nobles, although they are at the same time the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealthiest members of the community, will continue to defend themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,individually rather than submit; for if the conqueror remained master,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the country, he would deprive them of their political power, to which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they cling even more closely than to their property. They therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prefer fighting to subjection, which is to them the greatest of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,misfortunes; and they readily carry the people along with them because,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the people has long been used to follow and obey them, and besides has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but little to risk in the war. Amongst a nation in which equality of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conditions prevails, each citizen, on the contrary, has but slender","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"share of political power, and often has no share at all; on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand, all are independent, and all have something to lose; so that they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are much less afraid of being conquered, and much more afraid of war,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than an aristocratic people. It will always be extremely difficult to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"decide a democratic population to take up arms, when hostilities have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reached its own territory. Hence the necessity of giving to such a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people the rights and the political character which may impart to every,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizen some of those interests that cause the nobles to act for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public welfare in aristocratic countries.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It should never be forgotten by the princes and other leaders of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations, that nothing but the passion and the habit of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,freedom can maintain an advantageous contest with the passion and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habit of physical well-being. I can conceive nothing better prepared,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for subjection, in case of defeat, than a democratic people without free","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,institutions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Formerly it was customary to take the field with a small body of troops,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to fight in small engagements, and to make long, regular sieges: modern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tactics consist in fighting decisive battles, and, as soon as a line","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of march is open before the army, in rushing upon the capital city, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order to terminate the war at a single blow. Napoleon, it is said, was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the inventor of this new system; but the invention of such a system did,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not depend on any individual man, whoever he might be. The mode in which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Napoleon carried on war was suggested to him by the state of society in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his time; that mode was successful, because it was eminently adapted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to that state of society, and because he was the first to employ it.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Napoleon was the first commander who marched at the head of an army,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from capital to capital, but the road was opened for him by the ruin of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"feudal society. It may fairly be believed that, if that extraordinary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man had been born three hundred years ago, he would not have derived the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same results from his method of warfare, or, rather, that he would have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had a different method.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I shall add but a few words on civil wars, for fear of exhausting the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,patience of the reader. Most of the remarks which I have made respecting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,foreign wars are applicable a fortiori to civil wars. Men living in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democracies are not naturally prone to the military character; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sometimes assume it, when they have been dragged by compulsion to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,field; but to rise in a body and voluntarily to expose themselves to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"horrors of war, and especially of civil war, is a course which the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men of democracies are not apt to adopt. None but the most adventurous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of the community consent to run into such risks; the bulk of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,population remains motionless. But even if the population were inclined,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to act, considerable obstacles would stand in their way; for they can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resort to no old and well-established influence which they are willing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to obey--no well-known leaders to rally the discontented, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to discipline and to lead them--no political powers subordinate to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supreme power of the nation, which afford an effectual support to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resistance directed against the government. In democratic countries the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"moral power of the majority is immense, and the physical resources","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which it has at its command are out of all proportion to the physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resources which may be combined against it. Therefore the party which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occupies the seat of the majority, which speaks in its name and wields","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its power, triumphs instantaneously and irresistibly over all private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resistance; it does not even give such opposition time to exist,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but nips it in the bud. Those who in such nations seek to effect a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,revolution by force of arms have no other resource than suddenly to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seize upon the whole engine of government as it stands, which can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,better be done by a single blow than by a war; for as soon as there is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a regular war, the party which represents the State is always certain to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conquer. The only case in which a civil war could arise is, if the army","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should divide itself into two factions, the one raising the standard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of rebellion, the other remaining true to its allegiance. An army","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitutes a small community, very closely united together, endowed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with great powers of vitality, and able to supply its own wants for some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time. Such a war might be bloody, but it could not be long; for either","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the rebellious army would gain over the government by the sole display,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of its resources, or by its first victory, and then the war would be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"over; or the struggle would take place, and then that portion of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,army which should not be supported by the organized powers of the State,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,would speedily either disband itself or be destroyed. It may therefore,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be admitted as a general truth, that in ages of equality civil wars will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,become much less frequent and less protracted. *c,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter I: That Equality Naturally Gives Men A Taste For Free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Institutions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I should imperfectly fulfil the purpose of this book, if, after having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shown what opinions and sentiments are suggested by the principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, I did not point out, ere I conclude, the general influence","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which these same opinions and sentiments may exercise upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government of human societies. To succeed in this object I shall,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently have to retrace my steps; but I trust the reader will not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"refuse to follow me through paths already known to him, which may lead","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to some new truth.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The principle of equality, which makes men independent of each other,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gives them a habit and a taste for following, in their private actions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no other guide but their own will. This complete independence, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they constantly enjoy towards their equals and in the intercourse of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private life, tends to make them look upon all authority with a jealous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"eye, and speedily suggests to them the notion and the love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political freedom. Men living at such times have a natural bias to free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"institutions. Take any one of them at a venture, and search if you can","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his most deep-seated instincts; you will find that of all governments he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will soonest conceive and most highly value that government, whose head","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he has himself elected, and whose administration he may control. Of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the political effects produced by the equality of conditions, this love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of independence is the first to strike the observing, and to alarm the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"timid; nor can it be said that their alarm is wholly misplaced, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,anarchy has a more formidable aspect in democratic countries than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elsewhere. As the citizens have no direct influence on each other, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"soon as the supreme power of the nation fails, which kept them all in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their several stations, it would seem that disorder must instantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reach its utmost pitch, and that, every man drawing aside in a different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"direction, the fabric of society must at once crumble away.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am, however, persuaded that anarchy is not the principal evil which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages have to fear, but the least. For the principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of equality begets two tendencies; the one leads men straight to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence, and may suddenly drive them into anarchy; the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conducts them by a longer, more secret, but more certain road, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servitude. Nations readily discern the former tendency, and are prepared","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to resist it; they are led away by the latter, without perceiving its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"drift; hence it is peculiarly important to point it out. For myself, I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,am so far from urging as a reproach to the principle of equality that it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"renders men untractable, that this very circumstance principally calls","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forth my approbation. I admire to see how it deposits in the mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and heart of man the dim conception and instinctive love of political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence, thus preparing the remedy for the evil which it engenders;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is on this very account that I am attached to it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter II: That The Notions Of Democratic Nations On Government Are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Naturally Favorable To The Concentration Of Power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The notion of secondary powers, placed between the sovereign and his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subjects, occurred naturally to the imagination of aristocratic nations,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because those communities contained individuals or families raised above,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the common level, and apparently destined to command by their birth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their education, and their wealth. This same notion is naturally wanting","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the minds of men in democratic ages, for converse reasons: it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can only be introduced artificially, it can only be kept there with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"difficulty; whereas they conceive, as it were, without thinking upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subject, the notion of a sole and central power which governs the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community by its direct influence. Moreover in politics, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in philosophy and in religion, the intellect of democratic nations is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,peculiarly open to simple and general notions. Complicated systems are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"repugnant to it, and its favorite conception is that of a great nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"composed of citizens all resembling the same pattern, and all governed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by a single power.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The very next notion to that of a sole and central power, which presents","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"itself to the minds of men in the ages of equality, is the notion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uniformity of legislation. As every man sees that he differs but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"little from those about him, he cannot understand why a rule which is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,applicable to one man should not be equally applicable to all others.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Hence the slightest privileges are repugnant to his reason; the faintest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dissimilarities in the political institutions of the same people offend,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him, and uniformity of legislation appears to him to be the first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of good government. I find, on the contrary, that this same","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notion of a uniform rule, equally binding on all the members of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community, was almost unknown to the human mind in aristocratic ages;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it was either never entertained, or it was rejected. These contrary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tendencies of opinion ultimately turn on either side to such blind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,instincts and such ungovernable habits that they still direct the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"actions of men, in spite of particular exceptions. Notwithstanding the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immense variety of conditions in the Middle Ages, a certain number of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persons existed at that period in precisely similar circumstances; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this did not prevent the laws then in force from assigning to each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of them distinct duties and different rights. On the contrary, at the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,present time all the powers of government are exerted to impose the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same customs and the same laws on populations which have as yet but few,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,points of resemblance. As the conditions of men become equal amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a people, individuals seem of less importance, and society of greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dimensions; or rather, every citizen, being assimilated to all the rest,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is lost in the crowd, and nothing stands conspicuous but the great and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,imposing image of the people at large. This naturally gives the men of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic periods a lofty opinion of the privileges of society, and a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very humble notion of the rights of individuals; they are ready to admit,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that the interests of the former are everything, and those of the latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing. They are willing to acknowledge that the power which represents,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the community has far more information and wisdom than any of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of that community; and that it is the duty, as well as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"right, of that power to guide as well as govern each private citizen.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If we closely scrutinize our contemporaries, and penetrate to the root","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of their political opinions, we shall detect some of the notions which I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have just pointed out, and we shall perhaps be surprised to find so much","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accordance between men who are so often at variance. The Americans hold,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that in every State the supreme power ought to emanate from the people;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but when once that power is constituted, they can conceive, as it were,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"no limits to it, and they are ready to admit that it has the right to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do whatever it pleases. They have not the slightest notion of peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privileges granted to cities, families, or persons: their minds appear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,never to have foreseen that it might be possible not to apply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with strict uniformity the same laws to every part, and to all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inhabitants. These same opinions are more and more diffused in Europe;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they even insinuate themselves amongst those nations which most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vehemently reject the principle of the sovereignty of the people. Such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations assign a different origin to the supreme power, but they ascribe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to that power the same characteristics. Amongst them all, the idea of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,intermediate powers is weakened and obliterated: the idea of rights,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inherent in certain individuals is rapidly disappearing from the minds,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of men; the idea of the omnipotence and sole authority of society at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,large rises to fill its place. These ideas take root and spread in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proportion as social conditions become more equal, and men more alike;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are engendered by equality, and in turn they hasten the progress of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In France, where the revolution of which I am speaking has gone further","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than in any other European country, these opinions have got complete","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hold of the public mind. If we listen attentively to the language of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"various parties in France, we shall find that there is not one which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has not adopted them. Most of these parties censure the conduct of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government, but they all hold that the government ought perpetually to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,act and interfere in everything that is done. Even those which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most at variance are nevertheless agreed upon this head. The unity, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ubiquity, the omnipotence of the supreme power, and the uniformity of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its rules, constitute the principal characteristics of all the political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,systems which have been put forward in our age. They recur even in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wildest visions of political regeneration: the human mind pursues them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in its dreams. If these notions spontaneously arise in the minds of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private individuals, they suggest themselves still more forcibly to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the minds of princes. Whilst the ancient fabric of European society,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is altered and dissolved, sovereigns acquire new conceptions of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,opportunities and their duties; they learn for the first time that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,central power which they represent may and ought to administer by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its own agency, and on a uniform plan, all the concerns of the whole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"community. This opinion, which, I will venture to say, was never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conceived before our time by the monarchs of Europe, now sinks deeply","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into the minds of kings, and abides there amidst all the agitation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more unsettled thoughts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Our contemporaries are therefore much less divided than is commonly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,supposed; they are constantly disputing as to the hands in which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supremacy is to be vested, but they readily agree upon the duties and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the rights of that supremacy. The notion they all form of government is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that of a sole, simple, providential, and creative power. All secondary","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinions in politics are unsettled; this one remains fixed, invariable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and consistent. It is adopted by statesmen and political philosophers;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is eagerly laid hold of by the multitude; those who govern and those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who are governed agree to pursue it with equal ardor: it is the foremost,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notion of their minds, it seems inborn. It originates therefore in no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"caprice of the human intellect, but it is a necessary condition of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,present state of mankind.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter III: That The Sentiments Of Democratic Nations Accord With Their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Opinions In Leading Them To Concentrate Political Power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If it be true that, in ages of equality, men readily adopt the notion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a great central power, it cannot be doubted on the other hand that their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habits and sentiments predispose them to recognize such a power and to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"give it their support. This may be demonstrated in a few words, as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"greater part of the reasons, to which the fact may be attributed, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,been previously stated. *a As the men who inhabit democratic countries,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have no superiors, no inferiors, and no habitual or necessary partners","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in their undertakings, they readily fall back upon themselves and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consider themselves as beings apart. I had occasion to point this out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at considerable length in treating of individualism. Hence such men can,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"never, without an effort, tear themselves from their private affairs to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engage in public business; their natural bias leads them to abandon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,latter to the sole visible and permanent representative of the interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community, that is to say, to the State. Not only are they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"naturally wanting in a taste for public business, but they have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently no time to attend to it. Private life is so busy in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic periods, so excited, so full of wishes and of work, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hardly any energy or leisure remains to each individual for public life.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I am the last man to contend that these propensities are unconquerable,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,since my chief object in writing this book has been to combat them. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only maintain that at the present day a secret power is fostering them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the human heart, and that if they are not checked they will wholly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,overgrow it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: See Appendix W.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have also had occasion to show how the increasing love of well-being,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the fluctuating character of property, cause democratic nations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to dread all violent disturbance. The love of public tranquillity is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequently the only passion which these nations retain, and it becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more active and powerful amongst them in proportion as all other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passions droop and die. This naturally disposes the members of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,community constantly to give or to surrender additional rights to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"central power, which alone seems to be interested in defending them by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same means that it uses to defend itself. As in ages of equality no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man is compelled to lend his assistance to his fellow-men, and none","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has any right to expect much support from them, everyone is at once","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independent and powerless. These two conditions, which must never be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"either separately considered or confounded together, inspire the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizen of a democratic country with very contrary propensities. His,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence fills him with self-reliance and pride amongst his equals;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his debility makes him feel from time to time the want of some outward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assistance, which he cannot expect from any of them, because they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all impotent and unsympathizing. In this predicament he naturally turns,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his eyes to that imposing power which alone rises above the level of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,universal depression. Of that power his wants and especially his desires,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"continually remind him, until he ultimately views it as the sole and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,necessary support of his own weakness. *b This may more completely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"explain what frequently takes place in democratic countries, where the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very men who are so impatient of superiors patiently submit to a master,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exhibiting at once their pride and their servility.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote b: In democratic communities nothing but the central power has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,any stability in its position or any permanence in its undertakings. All,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the members of society are in ceaseless stir and transformation. Now it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is in the nature of all governments to seek constantly to enlarge their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sphere of action; hence it is almost impossible that such a government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"should not ultimately succeed, because it acts with a fixed principle","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and a constant will, upon men, whose position, whose notions, and whose","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,desires are in continual vacillation. It frequently happens that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of the community promote the influence of the central power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without intending it. Democratic ages are periods of experiment,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"innovation, and adventure. At such times there are always a multitude of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men engaged in difficult or novel undertakings, which they follow alone,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without caring for their fellowmen. Such persons may be ready to admit,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as a general principle, that the public authority ought not to interfere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in private concerns; but, by an exception to that rule, each of them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,craves for its assistance in the particular concern on which he is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"engaged, and seeks to draw upon the influence of the government for his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own benefit, though he would restrict it on all other occasions. If a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,large number of men apply this particular exception to a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"variety of different purposes, the sphere of the central power extends","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"insensibly in all directions, although each of them wishes it to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,circumscribed. Thus a democratic government increases its power simply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the fact of its permanence. Time is on its side; every incident,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,befriends it; the passions of individuals unconsciously promote it; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it may be asserted, that the older a democratic community is, the more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,centralized will its government become.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The hatred which men bear to privilege increases in proportion as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privileges become more scarce and less considerable, so that democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,passions would seem to burn most fiercely at the very time when they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have least fuel. I have already given the reason of this phenomenon.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When all conditions are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the eye; whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of general uniformity: the more complete is this uniformity, the more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insupportable does the sight of such a difference become. Hence it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with equality itself, and that it should grow by what it feeds upon.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This never-dying, ever-kindling hatred, which sets a democratic people","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"against the smallest privileges, is peculiarly favorable to the gradual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concentration of all political rights in the hands of the representative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the State alone. The sovereign, being necessarily and incontestably","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"above all the citizens, excites not their envy, and each of them thinks","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that he strips his equals of the prerogative which he concedes to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,crown. The man of a democratic age is extremely reluctant to obey his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,neighbor who is his equal; he refuses to acknowledge in such a person,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ability superior to his own; he mistrusts his justice, and is jealous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his power; he fears and he contemns him; and he loves continually to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remind him of the common dependence in which both of them stand to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same master. Every central power which follows its natural tendencies,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,courts and encourages the principle of equality; for equality singularly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"facilitates, extends, and secures the influence of a central power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In like manner it may be said that every central government worships,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uniformity: uniformity relieves it from inquiry into an infinite number,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of small details which must be attended to if rules were to be adapted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to men, instead of indiscriminately subjecting men to rules: thus the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government likes what the citizens like, and naturally hates what they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hate. These common sentiments, which, in democratic nations, constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unite the sovereign and every member of the community in one and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same conviction, establish a secret and lasting sympathy between them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The faults of the government are pardoned for the sake of its tastes;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,public confidence is only reluctantly withdrawn in the midst even of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its excesses and its errors, and it is restored at the first call.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic nations often hate those in whose hands the central power is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,vested; but they always love that power itself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus, by two separate paths, I have reached the same conclusion. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shown that the principle of equality suggests to men the notion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a sole, uniform, and strong government: I have now shown that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,principle of equality imparts to them a taste for it. To governments of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this kind the nations of our age are therefore tending. They are drawn,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thither by the natural inclination of mind and heart; and in order to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reach that result, it is enough that they do not check themselves in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their course. I am of opinion, that, in the democratic ages which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opening upon us, individual independence and local liberties will ever","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be the produce of artificial contrivance; that centralization will be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the natural form of government. *c,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"A People To Complete Centralization Of Government, Or Which Divert Them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,From It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,If all democratic nations are instinctively led to the centralization of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government, they tend to this result in an unequal manner. This depends","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on the particular circumstances which may promote or prevent the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural consequences of that state of society--circumstances which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exceedingly numerous; but I shall only advert to a few of them. Amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men who have lived free long before they became equal, the tendencies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"derived from free institutions combat, to a certain extent, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,propensities superinduced by the principle of equality; and although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the central power may increase its privileges amongst such a people, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private members of such a community will never entirely forfeit their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independence. But when the equality of conditions grows up amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people which has never known, or has long ceased to know, what freedom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is (and such is the case upon the Continent of Europe), as the former","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"habits of the nation are suddenly combined, by some sort of natural","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attraction, with the novel habits and principles engendered by the state","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of society, all powers seem spontaneously to rush to the centre.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These powers accumulate there with astonishing rapidity, and the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instantly attains the utmost limits of its strength, whilst private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persons allow themselves to sink as suddenly to the lowest degree of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weakness.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The English who emigrated three hundred years ago to found a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commonwealth on the shores of the New World, had all learned to take","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a part in public affairs in their mother-country; they were conversant,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with trial by jury; they were accustomed to liberty of speech and of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"press--to personal freedom, to the notion of rights and the practice","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of asserting them. They carried with them to America these free,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"institutions and manly customs, and these institutions preserved them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,against the encroachments of the State. Thus amongst the Americans it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is freedom which is old--equality is of comparatively modern date. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reverse is occurring in Europe, where equality, introduced by absolute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power and under the rule of kings, was already infused into the habits","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of nations long before freedom had entered into their conceptions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have said that amongst democratic nations the notion of government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,naturally presents itself to the mind under the form of a sole and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"central power, and that the notion of intermediate powers is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,familiar to them. This is peculiarly applicable to the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations which have witnessed the triumph of the principle of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by means of a violent revolution. As the classes which managed local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"affairs have been suddenly swept away by the storm, and as the confused","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mass which remains has as yet neither the organization nor the habits,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which fit it to assume the administration of these same affairs, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,State alone seems capable of taking upon itself all the details of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government, and centralization becomes, as it were, the unavoidable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,state of the country. Napoleon deserves neither praise nor censure for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,having centred in his own hands almost all the administrative power,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of France; for, after the abrupt disappearance of the nobility and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the higher rank of the middle classes, these powers devolved on him of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,course: it would have been almost as difficult for him to reject as to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,assume them. But no necessity of this kind has ever been felt by the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Americans, who, having passed through no revolution, and having governed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves from the first, never had to call upon the State to act for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a time as their guardian. Thus the progress of centralization amongst a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic people depends not only on the progress of equality, but on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the manner in which this equality has been established.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"At the commencement of a great democratic revolution, when hostilities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have but just broken out between the different classes of society, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people endeavors to centralize the public administration in the hands of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the government, in order to wrest the management of local affairs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the aristocracy. Towards the close of such a revolution, on the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contrary, it is usually the conquered aristocracy that endeavors to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"make over the management of all affairs to the State, because such an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocracy dreads the tyranny of a people which has become its equal,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and not unfrequently its master. Thus it is not always the same class,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the community which strives to increase the prerogative of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government; but as long as the democratic revolution lasts there is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always one class in the nation, powerful in numbers or in wealth, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is induced, by peculiar passions or interests, to centralize the public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"administration, independently of that hatred of being governed by one's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"neighbor, which is a general and permanent feeling amongst democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nations. It may be remarked, that at the present day the lower orders in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"England are striving with all their might to destroy local independence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to transfer the administration from all points of the circumference,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the centre; whereas the higher classes are endeavoring to retain this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,administration within its ancient boundaries. I venture to predict that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a time will come when the very reverse will happen.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These observations explain why the supreme power is always stronger, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private individuals weaker, amongst a democratic people which has passed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,through a long and arduous struggle to reach a state of equality than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst a democratic community in which the citizens have been equal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the first. The example of the Americans completely demonstrates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the fact. The inhabitants of the United States were never divided by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,any privileges; they have never known the mutual relation of master and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inferior, and as they neither dread nor hate each other, they have never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,known the necessity of calling in the supreme power to manage their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,affairs. The lot of the Americans is singular: they have derived from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the aristocracy of England the notion of private rights and the taste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for local freedom; and they have been able to retain both the one and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the other, because they have had no aristocracy to combat.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If at all times education enables men to defend their independence, this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is most especially true in democratic ages. When all men are alike, it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is easy to found a sole and all-powerful government, by the aid of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mere instinct. But men require much intelligence, knowledge, and art to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"organize and to maintain secondary powers under similar circumstances,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to create amidst the independence and individual weakness of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,citizens such free associations as may be in a condition to struggle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,against tyranny without destroying public order.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Hence the concentration of power and the subjection of individuals will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increase amongst democratic nations, not only in the same proportion","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as their equality, but in the same proportion as their ignorance. It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is true, that in ages of imperfect civilization the government is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently as wanting in the knowledge required to impose a despotism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon the people as the people are wanting in the knowledge required to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,shake it off; but the effect is not the same on both sides. However rude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people may be, the central power which rules it is never","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"completely devoid of cultivation, because it readily draws to its own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uses what little cultivation is to be found in the country, and, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessary, may seek assistance elsewhere. Hence, amongst a nation which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is ignorant as well as democratic, an amazing difference cannot fail","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,speedily to arise between the intellectual capacity of the ruler and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that of each of his subjects. This completes the easy concentration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of all power in his hands: the administrative function of the State is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually extended, because the State alone is competent to administer","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the affairs of the country. Aristocratic nations, however unenlightened","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they may be, never afford the same spectacle, because in them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,instruction is nearly equally diffused between the monarch and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,leading members of the community.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The pacha who now rules in Egypt found the population of that country,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"composed of men exceedingly ignorant and equal, and he has borrowed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,science and ability of Europe to govern that people. As the personal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attainments of the sovereign are thus combined with the ignorance and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic weakness of his subjects, the utmost centralization has been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"established without impediment, and the pacha has made the country his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufactory, and the inhabitants his workmen.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I think that extreme centralization of government ultimately enervates,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society, and thus after a length of time weakens the government itself;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but I do not deny that a centralized social power may be able to execute,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great undertakings with facility in a given time and on a particular,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"point. This is more especially true of war, in which success depends","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much more on the means of transferring all the resources of a nation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to one single point, than on the extent of those resources. Hence it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,chiefly in war that nations desire and frequently require to increase,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the powers of the central government. All men of military genius are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fond of centralization, which increases their strength; and all men of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centralizing genius are fond of war, which compels nations to combine","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all their powers in the hands of the government. Thus the democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tendency which leads men unceasingly to multiply the privileges of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"State, and to circumscribe the rights of private persons, is much more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rapid and constant amongst those democratic nations which are exposed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their position to great and frequent wars, than amongst all others.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have shown how the dread of disturbance and the love of well-being,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insensibly lead democratic nations to increase the functions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"central government, as the only power which appears to be intrinsically","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently strong, enlightened, and secure, to protect them from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"anarchy. I would now add, that all the particular circumstances","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which tend to make the state of a democratic community agitated and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"precarious, enhance this general propensity, and lead private persons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more and more to sacrifice their rights to their tranquility. A people,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is therefore never so disposed to increase the functions of central,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government as at the close of a long and bloody revolution, which, after","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"having wrested property from the hands of its former possessors,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has shaken all belief, and filled the nation with fierce hatreds,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conflicting interests, and contending factions. The love of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tranquillity becomes at such times an indiscriminating passion, and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,members of the community are apt to conceive a most inordinate devotion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to order.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have already examined several of the incidents which may concur to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"promote the centralization of power, but the principal cause still","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remains to be noticed. The foremost of the incidental causes which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may draw the management of all affairs into the hands of the ruler in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic countries, is the origin of that ruler himself, and his own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,propensities. Men who live in the ages of equality are naturally fond,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of central power, and are willing to extend its privileges; but if it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"happens that this same power faithfully represents their own interests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and exactly copies their own inclinations, the confidence they place in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it knows no bounds, and they think that whatever they bestow upon it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bestowed upon themselves.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The attraction of administrative powers to the centre will always be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less easy and less rapid under the reign of kings who are still in some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"way connected with the old aristocratic order, than under new princes,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the children of their own achievements, whose birth, prejudices,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"propensities, and habits appear to bind them indissolubly to the cause","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of equality. I do not mean that princes of aristocratic origin who live,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in democratic ages do not attempt to centralize; I believe they apply,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves to that object as diligently as any others. For them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sole advantages of equality lie in that direction; but their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opportunities are less great, because the community, instead of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"volunteering compliance with their desires, frequently obeys them with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reluctance. In democratic communities the rule is that centralization,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,must increase in proportion as the sovereign is less aristocratic. When,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an ancient race of kings stands at the head of an aristocracy, as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,natural prejudices of the sovereign perfectly accord with the natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prejudices of the nobility, the vices inherent in aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"communities have a free course, and meet with no corrective. The reverse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is the case when the scion of a feudal stock is placed at the head of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a democratic people. The sovereign is constantly led, by his education,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his habits, and his associations, to adopt sentiments suggested by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inequality of conditions, and the people tend as constantly, by their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"social condition, to those manners which are engendered by equality.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,At such times it often happens that the citizens seek to control the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"central power far less as a tyrannical than as an aristocratical power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and that they persist in the firm defence of their independence, not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only because they would remain free, but especially because they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,determined to remain equal. A revolution which overthrows an ancient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regal family, in order to place men of more recent growth at the head","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a democratic people, may temporarily weaken the central power; but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"however anarchical such a revolution may appear at first, we need not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hesitate to predict that its final and certain consequence will be to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extend and to secure the prerogatives of that power. The foremost or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indeed the sole condition which is required in order to succeed in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centralizing the supreme power in a democratic community, is to love","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, or to get men to believe you love it. Thus the science of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"despotism, which was once so complex, is simplified, and reduced as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were to a single principle.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter V: That Amongst The European Nations Of Our Time The Power Of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Governments Is Increasing, Although The Persons Who Govern Are Less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Stable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"On reflecting upon what has already been said, the reader will be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,startled and alarmed to find that in Europe everything seems to conduce,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the indefinite extension of the prerogatives of government, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"render all that enjoyed the rights of private independence more weak,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more subordinate, and more precarious. The democratic nations of Europe","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have all the general and permanent tendencies which urge the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the centralization of government, and they are moreover exposed to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of secondary and incidental causes with which the Americans are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unacquainted. It would seem as if every step they make towards equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,brings them nearer to despotism. And indeed if we do but cast our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"looks around, we shall be convinced that such is the fact. During the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic ages which preceded the present time, the sovereigns of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Europe had been deprived of, or had relinquished, many of the rights","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inherent in their power. Not a hundred years ago, amongst the greater","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part of European nations, numerous private persons and corporations were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently independent to administer justice, to raise and maintain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"troops, to levy taxes, and frequently even to make or interpret the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,law. The State has everywhere resumed to itself alone these natural,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attributes of sovereign power; in all matters of government the State,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tolerates no intermediate agent between itself and the people, and in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,general business it directs the people by its own immediate influence. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"am far from blaming this concentration of power, I simply point it out.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"At the same period a great number of secondary powers existed in Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which represented local interests and administered local affairs. Most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of these local authorities have already disappeared; all are speedily,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tending to disappear, or to fall into the most complete dependence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"From one end of Europe to the other the privileges of the nobility, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"liberties of cities, and the powers of provincial bodies, are either","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"destroyed or upon the verge of destruction. Europe has endured, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the course of the last half-century, many revolutions and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,counter-revolutions which have agitated it in opposite directions: but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all these perturbations resemble each other in one respect--they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all shaken or destroyed the secondary powers of government. The local,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,privileges which the French did not abolish in the countries they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conquered, have finally succumbed to the policy of the princes who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conquered the French. Those princes rejected all the innovations of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,French Revolution except centralization: that is the only principle they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consented to receive from such a source. My object is to remark, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all these various rights, which have been successively wrested, in our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time, from classes, corporations, and individuals, have not served","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to raise new secondary powers on a more democratic basis, but have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uniformly been concentrated in the hands of the sovereign. Everywhere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the State acquires more and more direct control over the humblest,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"members of the community, and a more exclusive power of governing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each of them in his smallest concerns. *a Almost all the charitable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,establishments of Europe were formerly in the hands of private persons,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,or of corporations; they are now almost all dependent on the supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government, and in many countries are actually administered by that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,power. The State almost exclusively undertakes to supply bread to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hungry, assistance and shelter to the sick, work to the idle, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"act as the sole reliever of all kinds of misery. Education, as well","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as charity, is become in most countries at the present day a national","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concern. The State receives, and often takes, the child from the arms of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the mother, to hand it over to official agents: the State undertakes to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,train the heart and to instruct the mind of each generation. Uniformity,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prevails in the courses of public instruction as in everything else;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"diversity, as well as freedom, is disappearing day by day. Nor do I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hesitate to affirm, that amongst almost all the Christian nations of our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"days, Catholic as well as Protestant, religion is in danger of falling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,into the hands of the government. Not that rulers are over-jealous of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the right of settling points of doctrine, but they get more and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hold upon the will of those by whom doctrines are expounded; they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"deprive the clergy of their property, and pay them by salaries; they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"divert to their own use the influence of the priesthood, they make them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their own ministers--often their own servants--and by this alliance with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,religion they reach the inner depths of the soul of man. *b,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: This gradual weakening of individuals in relation to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society at large may be traced in a thousand ways. I shall select,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from amongst these examples one derived from the law of wills. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracies it is common to profess the greatest reverence for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,last testamentary dispositions of a man; this feeling sometimes even,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,became superstitious amongst the older nations of Europe: the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the State, far from interfering with the caprices of a dying man, gave","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"full force to the very least of them, and insured to him a perpetual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power. When all living men are enfeebled, the will of the dead is less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respected: it is circumscribed within a narrow range, beyond which it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is annulled or checked by the supreme power of the laws. In the Middle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Ages, testamentary power had, so to speak, no limits: amongst the French","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at the present day, a man cannot distribute his fortune amongst his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,children without the interference of the State; after having domineered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"over a whole life, the law insists upon regulating the very last act of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote b: In proportion as the duties of the central power are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"augmented, the number of public officers by whom that power is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,represented must increase also. They form a nation in each nation; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as they share the stability of the government, they more and more fill","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,up the place of an aristocracy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In almost every part of Europe the government rules in two ways; it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rules one portion of the community by the fear which they entertain of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its agents, and the other by the hope they have of becoming its agents.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But this is as yet only one side of the picture. The authority of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government has not only spread, as we have just seen, throughout the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sphere of all existing powers, till that sphere can no longer contain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it, but it goes further, and invades the domain heretofore reserved","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to private independence. A multitude of actions, which were formerly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"entirely beyond the control of the public administration, have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subjected to that control in our time, and the number of them is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly increasing. Amongst aristocratic nations the supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government usually contented itself with managing and superintending,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the community in whatever directly and ostensibly concerned the national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,honor; but in all other respects the people were left to work out their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own free will. Amongst these nations the government often seemed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,forget that there is a point at which the faults and the sufferings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private persons involve the general prosperity, and that to prevent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the ruin of a private individual must sometimes be a matter of public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance. The democratic nations of our time lean to the opposite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extreme. It is evident that most of our rulers will not content,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,themselves with governing the people collectively: it would seem as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,if they thought themselves responsible for the actions and private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,condition of their subjects--as if they had undertaken to guide and to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instruct each of them in the various incidents of life, and to secure","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their happiness quite independently of their own consent. On the other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hand private individuals grow more and more apt to look upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,supreme power in the same light; they invoke its assistance in all their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessities, and they fix their eyes upon the administration as their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mentor or their guide.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I assert that there is no country in Europe in which the public,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"administration has not become, not only more centralized, but more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inquisitive and more minute it everywhere interferes in private concerns,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more than it did; it regulates more undertakings, and undertakings of a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lesser kind; and it gains a firmer footing every day about, above, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"around all private persons, to assist, to advise, and to coerce them.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Formerly a sovereign lived upon the income of his lands, or the revenue","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of his taxes; this is no longer the case now that his wants have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increased as well as his power. Under the same circumstances which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"formerly compelled a prince to put on a new tax, he now has recourse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to a loan. Thus the State gradually becomes the debtor of most of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealthier members of the community, and centralizes the largest amounts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of capital in its own hands. Small capital is drawn into its keeping,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by another method. As men are intermingled and conditions become more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, the poor have more resources, more education, and more desires;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they conceive the notion of bettering their condition, and this teaches","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them to save. These savings are daily producing an infinite number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"small capitals, the slow and gradual produce of labor, which are always","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increasing. But the greater part of this money would be unproductive if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it remained scattered in the hands of its owners. This circumstance has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"given rise to a philanthropic institution, which will soon become, if I","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"am not mistaken, one of our most important political institutions. Some","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,charitable persons conceived the notion of collecting the savings of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the poor and placing them out at interest. In some countries these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,benevolent associations are still completely distinct from the State;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but in almost all they manifestly tend to identify themselves with the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government; and in some of them the government has superseded them,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"taking upon itself the enormous task of centralizing in one place, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"putting out at interest on its own responsibility, the daily savings of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,many millions of the working classes. Thus the State draws to itself the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wealth of the rich by loans, and has the poor man's mite at its disposal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the savings banks. The wealth of the country is perpetually flowing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,around the government and passing through its hands; the accumulation,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,increases in the same proportion as the equality of conditions; for in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a democratic country the State alone inspires private individuals with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confidence, because the State alone appears to be endowed with strength","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and durability. *c Thus the sovereign does not confine himself to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the management of the public treasury; he interferes in private money,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"matters; he is the superior, and often the master, of all the members","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the community; and, in addition to this, he assumes the part of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,steward and paymaster.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote c: On the one hand the taste for worldly welfare is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually increasing, and on the other the government gets more and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more complete possession of the sources of that welfare. Thus men are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,following two separate roads to servitude: the taste for their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"welfare withholds them from taking a part in the government, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,love of that welfare places them in closer dependence upon those who,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,govern.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The central power not only fulfils of itself the whole of the duties,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"formerly discharged by various authorities--extending those duties, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"surpassing those authorities--but it performs them with more alertness,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength, and independence than it displayed before. All the governments","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of Europe have in our time singularly improved the science of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"administration: they do more things, and they do everything with more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order, more celerity, and at less expense; they seem to be constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enriched by all the experience of which they have stripped private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persons. From day to day the princes of Europe hold their subordinate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"officers under stricter control, and they invent new methods for guiding","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them more closely, and inspecting them with less trouble. Not content","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with managing everything by their agents, they undertake to manage the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conduct of their agents in everything; so that the public administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not only depends upon one and the same power, but it is more and more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confined to one spot and concentrated in the same hands. The government,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,centralizes its agency whilst it increases its prerogative--hence a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,twofold increase of strength.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In examining the ancient constitution of the judicial power, amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most European nations, two things strike the mind--the independence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that power, and the extent of its functions. Not only did the courts of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"justice decide almost all differences between private persons, but in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,very many cases they acted as arbiters between private persons and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,State. I do not here allude to the political and administrative offices,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which courts of judicature had in some countries usurped, but the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"judicial office common to them all. In most of the countries of Europe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there were, and there still are, many private rights, connected for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the most part with the general right of property, which stood under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the protection of the courts of justice, and which the State could not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,violate without their sanction. It was this semi-political power which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mainly distinguished the European courts of judicature from all others;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for all nations have had judges, but all have not invested their judges","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,with the same privileges. Upon examining what is now occurring amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the democratic nations of Europe which are called free, as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst the others, it will be observed that new and more dependent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"courts are everywhere springing up by the side of the old ones, for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the express purpose of deciding, by an extraordinary jurisdiction,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such litigated matters as may arise between the government and private,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons. The elder judicial power retains its independence, but its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,jurisdiction is narrowed; and there is a growing tendency to reduce it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to be exclusively the arbiter between private interests. The number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these special courts of justice is continually increasing, and their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,functions increase likewise. Thus the government is more and more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,absolved from the necessity of subjecting its policy and its rights to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the sanction of another power. As judges cannot be dispensed with, at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"least the State is to select them, and always to hold them under its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"control; so that, between the government and private individuals, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,place the effigy of justice rather than justice itself. The State is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not satisfied with drawing all concerns to itself, but it acquires an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ever-increasing power of deciding on them all without restriction and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without appeal. *d,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote d: A strange sophism has been made on this head in France.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When a suit arises between the government and a private person, it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not to be tried before an ordinary judge--in order, they say, not to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,mix the administrative and the judicial powers; as if it were not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mix those powers, and to mix them in the most dangerous and oppressive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manner, to invest the government with the office of judging and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,administering at the same time.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"There exists amongst the modern nations of Europe one great cause,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independent of all those which have already been pointed out, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perpetually contributes to extend the agency or to strengthen the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prerogative of the supreme power, though it has not been sufficiently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attended to: I mean the growth of manufactures, which is fostered by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,progress of social equality. Manufactures generally collect a multitude,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of men of the same spot, amongst whom new and complex relations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spring up. These men are exposed by their calling to great and sudden,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alternations of plenty and want, during which public tranquillity is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,endangered. It may also happen that these employments sacrifice the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"health, and even the life, of those who gain by them, or of those who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"live by them. Thus the manufacturing classes require more regulation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superintendence, and restraint than the other classes of society, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is natural that the powers of government should increase in the same,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,proportion as those classes.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This is a truth of general application; what follows more especially,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,concerns the nations of Europe. In the centuries which preceded that in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which we live, the aristocracy was in possession of the soil, and was","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,competent to defend it: landed property was therefore surrounded by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ample securities, and its possessors enjoyed great independence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This gave rise to laws and customs which have been perpetuated,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notwithstanding the subdivision of lands and the ruin of the nobility;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and, at the present time, landowners and agriculturists are still those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,amongst the community who must easily escape from the control of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supreme power. In these same aristocratic ages, in which all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sources of our history are to be traced, personal property was of small","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"importance, and those who possessed it were despised and weak:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the manufacturing class formed an exception in the midst of those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic communities; as it had no certain patronage, it was not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"outwardly protected, and was often unable to protect itself.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Hence a habit sprung up of considering manufacturing property as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something of a peculiar nature, not entitled to the same deference,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and not worthy of the same securities as property in general; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufacturers were looked upon as a small class in the bulk of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people, whose independence was of small importance, and who might with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,propriety be abandoned to the disciplinary passions of princes. On,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"glancing over the codes of the middle ages, one is surprised to see,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in those periods of personal independence, with what incessant royal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regulations manufactures were hampered, even in their smallest details:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on this point centralization was as active and as minute as it can ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be. Since that time a great revolution has taken place in the world;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufacturing property, which was then only in the germ, has spread","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,till it covers Europe: the manufacturing class has been multiplied and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enriched by the remnants of all other ranks; it has grown and is still,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perpetually growing in number, in importance, in wealth. Almost all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those who do not belong to it are connected with it at least on some one,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"point; after having been an exception in society, it threatens to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"become the chief, if not the only, class; nevertheless the notions and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political precedents engendered by it of old still cling about it. These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notions and these precedents remain unchanged, because they are old,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and also because they happen to be in perfect accordance with the new,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,notions and general habits of our contemporaries. Manufacturing property,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,then does not extend its rights in the same ratio as its importance. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufacturing classes do not become less dependent, whilst they become","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more numerous; but, on the contrary, it would seem as if despotism","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lurked within them, and naturally grew with their growth. *e As a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation becomes more engaged in manufactures, the want of roads, canals,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"harbors, and other works of a semi-public nature, which facilitate the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"acquisition of wealth, is more strongly felt; and as a nation becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more democratic, private individuals are less able, and the State more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"able, to execute works of such magnitude. I do not hesitate to assert","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the manifest tendency of all governments at the present time is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take upon themselves alone the execution of these undertakings; by which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,means they daily hold in closer dependence the population which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,govern.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote e: I shall quote a few facts in corroboration of this remark.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Mines are the natural sources of manufacturing wealth: as manufactures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have grown up in Europe, as the produce of mines has become of more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"general importance, and good mining more difficult from the subdivision","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of property which is a consequence of the equality of conditions, most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,governments have asserted a right of owning the soil in which the mines,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lie, and of inspecting the works; which has never been the case with any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other kind of property. Thus mines, which were private property, liable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the same obligations and sheltered by the same guarantees as all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other landed property, have fallen under the control of the State.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The State either works them or farms them; the owners of them are mere,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tenants, deriving their rights from the State; and, moreover, the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost everywhere claims the power of directing their operations: it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lays down rules, enforces the adoption of particular methods, subjects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the mining adventurers to constant superintendence, and, if refractory,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they are ousted by a government court of justice, and the government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,transfers their contract to other hands; so that the government not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"only possesses the mines, but has all the adventurers in its power.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nevertheless, as manufactures increase, the working of old mines","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increases also; new ones are opened, the mining population extends and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"grows up; day by day governments augment their subterranean dominions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and people them with their agents.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"On the other hand, in proportion as the power of a State increases, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its necessities are augmented, the State consumption of manufactured","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"produce is always growing larger, and these commodities are generally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"made in the arsenals or establishments of the government. Thus, in every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kingdom, the ruler becomes the principal manufacturer; he collects","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and retains in his service a vast number of engineers, architects,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mechanics, and handicraftsmen. Not only is he the principal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manufacturer, but he tends more and more to become the chief, or rather","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the master of all other manufacturers. As private persons become,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more powerless by becoming more equal, they can effect nothing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures without combination; but the government naturally seeks to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,place these combinations under its own control.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"It must be admitted that these collective beings, which are called","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"combinations, are stronger and more formidable than a private individual","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can ever be, and that they have less of the responsibility of their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,actions; whence it seems reasonable that they should not be allowed to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,retain so great an independence of the supreme government as might be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceded to a private individual.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Rulers are the more apt to follow this line of policy, as their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inclinations invite them to it. Amongst democratic nations it is only by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,association that the resistance of the people to the government can ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,display itself: hence the latter always looks with ill-favor on those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,associations which are not in its own power; and it is well worthy of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remark, that amongst democratic nations, the people themselves often","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entertain a secret feeling of fear and jealousy against these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"very associations, which prevents the citizens from defending the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,institutions of which they stand so much in need. The power and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"duration of these small private bodies, in the midst of the weakness and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"instability of the whole community, astonish and alarm the people;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the free use which each association makes of its natural powers is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost regarded as a dangerous privilege. All the associations which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spring up in our age are, moreover, new corporate powers, whose rights","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have not been sanctioned by time; they come into existence at a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"time when the notion of private rights is weak, and when the power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government is unbounded; hence it is not surprising that they lose their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,freedom at their birth. Amongst all European nations there are some,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,kinds of associations which cannot be formed until the State has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"examined their by-laws, and authorized their existence. In several","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others, attempts are made to extend this rule to all associations; the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequences of such a policy, if it were successful, may easily be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,foreseen. If once the sovereign had a general right of authorizing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"associations of all kinds upon certain conditions, he would not be long","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without claiming the right of superintending and managing them, in order","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to prevent them from departing from the rules laid down by himself. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this manner, the State, after having reduced all who are desirous of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"forming associations into dependence, would proceed to reduce into the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,same condition all who belong to associations already formed--that is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to say, almost all the men who are now in existence. Governments thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"appropriate to themselves, and convert to their own purposes, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greater part of this new power which manufacturing interests have in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,our time brought into the world. Manufacturers govern us--they govern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,manufactures.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I attach so much importance to all that I have just been saying, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I am tormented by the fear of having impaired my meaning in seeking,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to render it more clear. If the reader thinks that the examples I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,adduced to support my observations are insufficient or ill-chosen--if,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he imagines that I have anywhere exaggerated the encroachments of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"supreme power, and, on the other hand, that I have underrated the extent","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the sphere which still remains open to the exertions of individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence, I entreat him to lay down the book for a moment, and to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,turn his mind to reflect for himself upon the subjects I have attempted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to explain. Let him attentively examine what is taking place in France,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and in other countries--let him inquire of those about him--let him,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"search himself, and I am much mistaken if he does not arrive, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"my guidance, and by other paths, at the point to which I have sought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to lead him. He will perceive that for the last half-century,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,centralization has everywhere been growing up in a thousand different,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ways. Wars, revolutions, conquests, have served to promote it: all men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"have labored to increase it. In the course of the same period, during","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which men have succeeded each other with singular rapidity at the head,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of affairs, their notions, interests, and passions have been infinitely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,diversified; but all have by some means or other sought to centralize.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,This instinctive centralization has been the only settled point amidst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the extreme mutability of their lives and of their thoughts.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If the reader, after having investigated these details of human affairs,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will seek to survey the wide prospect as a whole, he will be struck","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the result. On the one hand the most settled dynasties shaken or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,overthrown--the people everywhere escaping by violence from the sway,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of their laws--abolishing or limiting the authority of their rulers or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their princes--the nations, which are not in open revolution, restless","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at least, and excited--all of them animated by the same spirit of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolt: and on the other hand, at this very period of anarchy, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst these untractable nations, the incessant increase of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prerogative of the supreme government, becoming more centralized, more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adventurous, more absolute, more extensive--the people perpetually","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,falling under the control of the public administration--led,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insensibly to surrender to it some further portion of their individual,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence, till the very men, who from time to time upset a throne","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and trample on a race of kings, bend more and more obsequiously to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,slightest dictate of a clerk. Thus two contrary revolutions appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in our days to be going on; the one continually weakening the supreme,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power, the other as continually strengthening it: at no other period","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in our history has it appeared so weak or so strong. But upon a more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attentive examination of the state of the world, it appears that these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"two revolutions are intimately connected together, that they originate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in the same source, and that after having followed a separate course,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they lead men at last to the same result. I may venture once more to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,repeat what I have already said or implied in several parts of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,book: great care must be taken not to confound the principle of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself with the revolution which finally establishes that principle in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the social condition and the laws of a nation: here lies the reason of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all the phenomena which occasion our astonishment. All the old,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"political powers of Europe, the greatest as well as the least, were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"founded in ages of aristocracy, and they more or less represented or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,defended the principles of inequality and of privilege. To make the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"novel wants and interests, which the growing principle of equality","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"introduced, preponderate in government, our contemporaries had to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,overturn or to coerce the established powers. This led them to make,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutions, and breathed into many of them, that fierce love of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disturbance and independence, which all revolutions, whatever be their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"object, always engender. I do not believe that there is a single country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in Europe in which the progress of equality has not been preceded or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,followed by some violent changes in the state of property and persons;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and almost all these changes have been attended with much anarchy and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"license, because they have been made by the least civilized portion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the nation against that which is most civilized. Hence proceeded the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,two-fold contrary tendencies which I have just pointed out. As long as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the democratic revolution was glowing with heat, the men who were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,bent upon the destruction of old aristocratic powers hostile to that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolution, displayed a strong spirit of independence; but as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"victory or the principle of equality became more complete, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gradually surrendered themselves to the propensities natural to that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of equality, and they strengthened and centralized their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,governments. They had sought to be free in order to make themselves,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equal; but in proportion as equality was more established by the aid,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of freedom, freedom itself was thereby rendered of more difficult","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attainment.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,These two states of a nation have sometimes been contemporaneous:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the last generation in France showed how a people might organize a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stupendous tyranny in the community, at the very time when they were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,baffling the authority of the nobility and braving the power of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kings--at once teaching the world the way to win freedom, and the way to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,lose it. In our days men see that constituted powers are dilapidated,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on every side--they see all ancient authority gasping away, all ancient","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"barriers tottering to their fall, and the judgment of the wisest is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,troubled at the sight: they attend only to the amazing revolution which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is taking place before their eyes, and they imagine that mankind is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,about to fall into perpetual anarchy: if they looked to the final,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequences of this revolution, their fears would perhaps assume a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different shape. For myself, I confess that I put no trust in the spirit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of freedom which appears to animate my contemporaries. I see well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enough that the nations of this age are turbulent, but I do not clearly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"perceive that they are liberal; and I fear lest, at the close of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"those perturbations which rock the base of thrones, the domination of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sovereigns may prove more powerful than it ever was before.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Chapter VI: What Sort Of Despotism Democratic Nations Have To Fear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I had remarked during my stay in the United States, that a democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"state of society, similar to that of the Americans, might offer singular","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"facilities for the establishment of despotism; and I perceived, upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"my return to Europe, how much use had already been made by most of our","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rulers, of the notions, the sentiments, and the wants engendered by this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"same social condition, for the purpose of extending the circle of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their power. This led me to think that the nations of Christendom would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perhaps eventually undergo some sort of oppression like that which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hung over several of the nations of the ancient world. A more accurate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"examination of the subject, and five years of further meditations, have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not diminished my apprehensions, but they have changed the object of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. No sovereign ever lived in former ages so absolute or so powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as to undertake to administer by his own agency, and without the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assistance of intermediate powers, all the parts of a great empire: none","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ever attempted to subject all his subjects indiscriminately to strict,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uniformity of regulation, and personally to tutor and direct every","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,member of the community. The notion of such an undertaking never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occurred to the human mind; and if any man had conceived it, the want","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of information, the imperfection of the administrative system, and above","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all, the natural obstacles caused by the inequality of conditions, would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,speedily have checked the execution of so vast a design. When the Roman,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"emperors were at the height of their power, the different nations of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,empire still preserved manners and customs of great diversity; although,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they were subject to the same monarch, most of the provinces were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,separately administered; they abounded in powerful and active,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,municipalities; and although the whole government of the empire was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centred in the hands of the emperor alone, and he always remained, upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"occasions, the supreme arbiter in all matters, yet the details of social","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,life and private occupations lay for the most part beyond his control.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The emperors possessed, it is true, an immense and unchecked power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which allowed them to gratify all their whimsical tastes, and to employ","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for that purpose the whole strength of the State. They frequently abused,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that power arbitrarily to deprive their subjects of property or of life:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their tyranny was extremely onerous to the few, but it did not reach the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"greater number; it was fixed to some few main objects, and neglected the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rest; it was violent, but its range was limited.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But it would seem that if despotism were to be established amongst the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations of our days, it might assume a different character;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it would be more extensive and more mild; it would degrade men without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tormenting them. I do not question, that in an age of instruction","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and equality like our own, sovereigns might more easily succeed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"collecting all political power into their own hands, and might interfere","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more habitually and decidedly within the circle of private interests,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than any sovereign of antiquity could ever do. But this same principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of equality which facilitates despotism, tempers its rigor. We have seen","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,how the manners of society become more humane and gentle in proportion,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as men become more equal and alike. When no member of the community has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"much power or much wealth, tyranny is, as it were, without opportunities","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and a field of action. As all fortunes are scanty, the passions of men","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are naturally circumscribed--their imagination limited, their pleasures","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"simple. This universal moderation moderates the sovereign himself, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,checks within certain limits the inordinate extent of his desires.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Independently of these reasons drawn from the nature of the state of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society itself, I might add many others arising from causes beyond my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,subject; but I shall keep within the limits I have laid down to myself.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Democratic governments may become violent and even cruel at certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,periods of extreme effervescence or of great danger: but these crises,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,will be rare and brief. When I consider the petty passions of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contemporaries, the mildness of their manners, the extent of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"education, the purity of their religion, the gentleness of their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"morality, their regular and industrious habits, and the restraint which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they almost all observe in their vices no less than in their virtues,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,rather guardians. *a I think then that the species of oppression by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything which ever,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,before existed in the world: our contemporaries will find no prototype,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of it in their memories. I am trying myself to choose an expression,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but in vain; the old words ""despotism"" and ""tyranny"" are inappropriate:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the thing itself is new; and since I cannot name it, I must attempt to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,define it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,[Footnote a: See Appendix Y.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an innumerable multitude of men all equal and alike, incessantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"glut their lives. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fate of all the rest--his children and his private friends constitute to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"him the whole of mankind; as for the rest of his fellow-citizens, he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"close to them, but he sees them not--he touches them, but he feels them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not; he exists but in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"country. Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent, if,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,seeks on the contrary to keep them in perpetual childhood: it is well,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"happiness: it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subdivides their inheritances--what remains, but to spare them all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the care of thinking and all the trouble of living? Thus it every day,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself. The principle of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equality has prepared men for these things: it has predisposed men to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"endure them, and oftentimes to look on them as benefits.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,After having thus successively taken each member of the community in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its powerful grasp, and fashioned them at will, the supreme power then","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extends its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society with a net-work of small complicated rules, minute and uniform,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot penetrate, to rise above the crowd. The will of man is not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"shattered, but softened, bent, and guided: men are seldom forced by it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting: such a power","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each nation is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd. I have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always thought that servitude of the regular, quiet, and gentle kind","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which I have just described, might be combined more easily than is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,commonly believed with some of the outward forms of freedom; and that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it might even establish itself under the wing of the sovereignty of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people. Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"passions; they want to be led, and they wish to remain free: as they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot destroy either one or the other of these contrary propensities,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they strive to satisfy them both at once. They devise a sole, tutelary,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and all-powerful form of government, but elected by the people. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,combine the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this gives them a respite; they console themselves for being in tutelage,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians. Every man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"allows himself to be put in leading-strings, because he sees that it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not a person or a class of persons, but the people at large that holds","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the end of his chain. By this system the people shake off their state,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of dependence just long enough to select their master, and then relapse","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,into it again. A great many persons at the present day are quite,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contented with this sort of compromise between administrative despotism,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they have done enough,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for the protection of individual freedom when they have surrendered,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it to the power of the nation at large. This does not satisfy me:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the nature of him I am to obey signifies less to me than the fact of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extorted obedience.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I do not however deny that a constitution of this kind appears to me to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be infinitely preferable to one, which, after having concentrated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the powers of government, should vest them in the hands of an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,irresponsible person or body of persons. Of all the forms which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic despotism could assume, the latter would assuredly be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the worst. When the sovereign is elective, or narrowly watched by a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislature which is really elective and independent, the oppression","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which he exercises over individuals is sometimes greater, but it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"always less degrading; because every man, when he is oppressed and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disarmed, may still imagine, that whilst he yields obedience it is to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"himself he yields it, and that it is to one of his own inclinations that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the rest give way. In like manner I can understand that when the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sovereign represents the nation, and is dependent upon the people, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rights and the power of which every citizen is deprived, not only serve","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the head of the State, but the State itself; and that private persons","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,derive some return from the sacrifice of their independence which they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have made to the public. To create a representation of the people in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every centralized country, is therefore, to diminish the evil which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extreme centralization may produce, but not to get rid of it. I admit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that by this means room is left for the intervention of individuals in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the more important affairs; but it is not the less suppressed in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,smaller and more private ones. It must not be forgotten that it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life. For my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own part, I should be inclined to think freedom less necessary in great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"things than in little ones, if it were possible to be secure of the one","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without possessing the other. Subjection in minor affairs breaks out,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"every day, and is felt by the whole community indiscriminately. It does","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not drive men to resistance, but it crosses them at every turn, till","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they are led to surrender the exercise of their will. Thus their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spirit is gradually broken and their character enervated; whereas that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obedience, which is exacted on a few important but rare occasions, only","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exhibits servitude at certain intervals, and throws the burden of it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon a small number of men. It is in vain to summon a people, which has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been rendered so dependent on the central power, to choose from time to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time the representatives of that power; this rare and brief exercise of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their free choice, however important it may be, will not prevent them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from gradually losing the faculties of thinking, feeling, and acting for","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves, and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity. *b","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I add that they will soon become incapable of exercising the great and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,only privilege which remains to them. The democratic nations which have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"introduced freedom into their political constitution, at the very","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time when they were augmenting the despotism of their administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitution, have been led into strange paradoxes. To manage those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,minor affairs in which good sense is all that is wanted--the people are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"held to be unequal to the task, but when the government of the country","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is at stake, the people are invested with immense powers; they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alternately made the playthings of their ruler, and his masters--more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than kings, and less than men. After having exhausted all the different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"modes of election, without finding one to suit their purpose, they are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still amazed, and still bent on seeking further; as if the evil they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remark did not originate in the constitution of the country far more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than in that of the electoral body. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,how men who have entirely given up the habit of self-government should,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,succeed in making a proper choice of those by whom they are to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"governed; and no one will ever believe that a liberal, wise, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,energetic government can spring from the suffrages of a subservient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people. A constitution, which should be republican in its head and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ultra-monarchical in all its other parts, has ever appeared to me to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be a short-lived monster. The vices of rulers and the ineptitude of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people would speedily bring about its ruin; and the nation, weary of its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"representatives and of itself, would create freer institutions, or soon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,return to stretch itself at the feet of a single master.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VII: Continuation Of The Preceding Chapters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe that it is easier to establish an absolute and despotic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government amongst a people in which the conditions of society are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equal, than amongst any other; and I think that if such a government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were once established amongst such a people, it would not only oppress","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men, but would eventually strip each of them of several of the highest","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,qualities of humanity. Despotism therefore appears to me peculiarly to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be dreaded in democratic ages. I should have loved freedom, I believe,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at all times, but in the time in which we live I am ready to worship","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it. On the other hand, I am persuaded that all who shall attempt, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the ages upon which we are entering, to base freedom upon aristocratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privilege, will fail--that all who shall attempt to draw and to retain","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"authority within a single class, will fail. At the present day no ruler","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is skilful or strong enough to found a despotism, by re-establishing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permanent distinctions of rank amongst his subjects: no legislator is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wise or powerful enough to preserve free institutions, if he does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,take equality for his first principle and his watchword. All those of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,our contemporaries who would establish or secure the independence and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the dignity of their fellow-men, must show themselves the friends of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality; and the only worthy means of showing themselves as such, is to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be so: upon this depends the success of their holy enterprise. Thus the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"question is not how to reconstruct aristocratic society, but how to make","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,liberty proceed out of that democratic state of society in which God has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,placed us.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These two truths appear to me simple, clear, and fertile in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequences; and they naturally lead me to consider what kind of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,free government can be established amongst a people in which social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conditions are equal. It results from the very constitution of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic nations and from their necessities, that the power of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government amongst them must be more uniform, more centralized, more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extensive, more searching, and more efficient than in other countries.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Society at large is naturally stronger and more active, individuals more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subordinate and weak; the former does more, the latter less; and this is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inevitably the case. It is not therefore to be expected that the range,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of private independence will ever be as extensive in democratic as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in aristocratic countries--nor is this to be desired; for, amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic nations, the mass is often sacrificed to the individual,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the prosperity of the greater number to the greatness of the few.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It is both necessary and desirable that the government of a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,people should be active and powerful: and our object should not be to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"render it weak or indolent, but solely to prevent it from abusing its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aptitude and its strength.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The circumstance which most contributed to secure the independence of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private persons in aristocratic ages, was, that the supreme power did","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not affect to take upon itself alone the government and administration,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the community; those functions were necessarily partially left to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the members of the aristocracy: so that as the supreme power was always,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"divided, it never weighed with its whole weight and in the same manner","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on each individual. Not only did the government not perform everything,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,by its immediate agency; but as most of the agents who discharged its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"duties derived their power not from the State, but from the circumstance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of their birth, they were not perpetually under its control. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"government could not make or unmake them in an instant, at pleasure,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nor bend them in strict uniformity to its slightest caprice--this was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,an additional guarantee of private independence. I readily admit that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,recourse cannot be had to the same means at the present time: but I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discover certain democratic expedients which may be substituted for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. Instead of vesting in the government alone all the administrative,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"powers of which corporations and nobles have been deprived, a portion of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"them may be entrusted to secondary public bodies, temporarily composed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of private citizens: thus the liberty of private persons will be more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"secure, and their equality will not be diminished.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The Americans, who care less for words than the French, still designate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the name of ""county"" the largest of their administrative districts:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but the duties of the count or lord-lieutenant are in part performed by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a provincial assembly. At a period of equality like our own it would be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unjust and unreasonable to institute hereditary officers; but there is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nothing to prevent us from substituting elective public officers to a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,certain extent. Election is a democratic expedient which insures the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"independence of the public officer in relation to the government,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as much and even more than hereditary rank can insure it amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocratic nations. Aristocratic countries abound in wealthy and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"influential persons who are competent to provide for themselves, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who cannot be easily or secretly oppressed: such persons restrain a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government within general habits of moderation and reserve. I am very,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,well aware that democratic countries contain no such persons naturally;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but something analogous to them may be created by artificial means. I,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,firmly believe that an aristocracy cannot again be founded in the world;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but I think that private citizens, by combining together, may constitute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bodies of great wealth, influence, and strength, corresponding to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,persons of an aristocracy. By this means many of the greatest political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,advantages of aristocracy would be obtained without its injustice or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its dangers. An association for political, commercial, or manufacturing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"purposes, or even for those of science and literature, is a powerful","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and enlightened member of the community, which cannot be disposed of at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasure, or oppressed without remonstrance; and which, by defending its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own rights against the encroachments of the government, saves the common","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,liberties of the country.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,In periods of aristocracy every man is always bound so closely to many,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his fellow-citizens, that he cannot be assailed without their coming","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to his assistance. In ages of equality every man naturally stands alone;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he has no hereditary friends whose co-operation he may demand--no class,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon whose sympathy he may rely: he is easily got rid of, and he is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trampled on with impunity. At the present time, an oppressed member","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the community has therefore only one method of self-defence--he,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may appeal to the whole nation; and if the whole nation is deaf to his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"complaint, he may appeal to mankind: the only means he has of making","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,this appeal is by the press. Thus the liberty of the press is infinitely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more valuable amongst democratic nations than amongst all others; it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the only cure for the evils which equality may produce. Equality sets,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men apart and weakens them; but the press places a powerful weapon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"within every man's reach, which the weakest and loneliest of them all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,may use. Equality deprives a man of the support of his connections; but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the press enables him to summon all his fellow-countrymen and all his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fellow-men to his assistance. Printing has accelerated the progress of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equality, and it is also one of its best correctives.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I think that men living in aristocracies may, strictly speaking, do","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,without the liberty of the press: but such is not the case with those,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who live in democratic countries. To protect their personal independence,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I trust not to great political assemblies, to parliamentary privilege,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or to the assertion of popular sovereignty. All these things may, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a certain extent, be reconciled with personal servitude--but that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,servitude cannot be complete if the press is free: the press is the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,chiefest democratic instrument of freedom.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Something analogous may be said of the judicial power. It is a part of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the essence of judicial power to attend to private interests, and to fix","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,itself with predilection on minute objects submitted to its observation;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,another essential quality of judicial power is never to volunteer its,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assistance to the oppressed, but always to be at the disposal of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"humblest of those who solicit it; their complaint, however feeble they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"may themselves be, will force itself upon the ear of justice and claim","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"redress, for this is inherent in the very constitution of the courts","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of justice. A power of this kind is therefore peculiarly adapted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wants of freedom, at a time when the eye and finger of the government","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are constantly intruding into the minutest details of human actions, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"when private persons are at once too weak to protect themselves, and too","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,much isolated for them to reckon upon the assistance of their fellows.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The strength of the courts of law has ever been the greatest security,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which can be offered to personal independence; but this is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,especially the case in democratic ages: private rights and interests are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in constant danger, if the judicial power does not grow more extensive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and more strong to keep pace with the growing equality of conditions.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Equality awakens in men several propensities extremely dangerous to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"freedom, to which the attention of the legislator ought constantly to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,directed. I shall only remind the reader of the most important amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them. Men living in democratic ages do not readily comprehend the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,utility of forms: they feel an instinctive contempt for them--I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,elsewhere shown for what reasons. Forms excite their contempt and often,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,their hatred; as they commonly aspire to none but easy and present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"gratifications, they rush onwards to the object of their desires, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the slightest delay exasperates them. This same temper, carried","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with them into political life, renders them hostile to forms, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perpetually retard or arrest them in some of their projects. Yet this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,objection which the men of democracies make to forms is the very thing,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which renders forms so useful to freedom; for their chief merit is to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"serve as a barrier between the strong and the weak, the ruler and the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"people, to retard the one, and give the other time to look about him.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Forms become more necessary in proportion as the government becomes,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more active and more powerful, whilst private persons are becoming more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indolent and more feeble. Thus democratic nations naturally stand more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in need of forms than other nations, and they naturally respect them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,less. This deserves most serious attention. Nothing is more pitiful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,than the arrogant disdain of most of our contemporaries for questions,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of form; for the smallest questions of form have acquired in our time an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,importance which they never had before: many of the greatest interests,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of mankind depend upon them. I think that if the statesmen of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aristocratic ages could sometimes contemn forms with impunity, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"frequently rise above them, the statesmen to whom the government of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations is now confided ought to treat the very least among them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with respect, and not neglect them without imperious necessity. In","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,aristocracies the observance of forms was superstitious; amongst us they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ought to be kept with a deliberate and enlightened deference.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Another tendency, which is extremely natural to democratic nations and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extremely dangerous, is that which leads them ta despise and undervalue","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the rights of private persons. The attachment which men feel to a right,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and the respect which they display for it, is generally proportioned to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its importance, or to the length of time during which they have enjoyed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. The rights of private persons amongst democratic nations are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commonly of small importance, of recent growth, and extremely","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,precarious--the consequence is that they are often sacrificed without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"regret, and almost always violated without remorse. But it happens that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at the same period and amongst the same nations in which men conceive,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a natural contempt for the rights of private persons, the rights of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,society at large are naturally extended and consolidated: in other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"words, men become less attached to private rights at the very time at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which it would be most necessary to retain and to defend what little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remains of them. It is therefore most especially in the present,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic ages, that the true friends of the liberty and the greatness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of man ought constantly to be on the alert to prevent the power of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,government from lightly sacrificing the private rights of individuals,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the general execution of its designs. At such times no citizen is so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,obscure that it is not very dangerous to allow him to be oppressed--no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private rights are so unimportant that they can be surrendered with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,impunity to the caprices of a government. The reason is plain:--if the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private right of an individual is violated at a time when the human mind,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is fully impressed with the importance and the sanctity of such rights,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the injury done is confined to the individual whose right is infringed;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"but to violate such a right, at the present day, is deeply to corrupt","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the manners of the nation and to put the whole community in jeopardy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because the very notion of this kind of right constantly tends amongst,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,us to be impaired and lost.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"There are certain habits, certain notions, and certain vices which are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"peculiar to a state of revolution, and which a protracted revolution","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cannot fail to engender and to propagate, whatever be, in other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"respects, its character, its purpose, and the scene on which it takes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"place. When any nation has, within a short space of time, repeatedly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"varied its rulers, its opinions, and its laws, the men of whom it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"composed eventually contract a taste for change, and grow accustomed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to see all changes effected by sudden violence. Thus they naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,conceive a contempt for forms which daily prove ineffectual; and they do,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not support without impatience the dominion of rules which they have so,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,often seen infringed. As the ordinary notions of equity and morality no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,longer suffice to explain and justify all the innovations daily begotten,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by a revolution, the principle of public utility is called in, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"doctrine of political necessity is conjured up, and men accustom","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves to sacrifice private interests without scruple, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to trample on the rights of individuals in order more speedily to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,accomplish any public purpose.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"These habits and notions, which I shall call revolutionary, because all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutions produce them, occur in aristocracies just as much as amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,democratic nations; but amongst the former they are often less powerful,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and always less lasting, because there they meet with habits, notions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"defects, and impediments, which counteract them: they consequently","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disappear as soon as the revolution is terminated, and the nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reverts to its former political courses. This is not always the case,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic countries, in which it is ever to be feared that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutionary tendencies, becoming more gentle and more regular, without","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"entirely disappearing from society, will be gradually transformed into","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,habits of subjection to the administrative authority of the government.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I know of no countries in which revolutions re more dangerous than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in democratic countries; because, independently of the accidental and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transient evils which must always attend them, they may always create","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,some evils which are permanent and unending. I believe that there are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such things as justifiable resistance and legitimate rebellion: I do not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore assert, as an absolute proposition, that the men of democratic","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,ages ought never to make revolutions; but I think that they have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"especial reason to hesitate before they embark in them, and that it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,far better to endure many grievances in their present condition than to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have recourse to so perilous a remedy.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I shall conclude by one general idea, which comprises not only all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"particular ideas which have been expressed in the present chapter, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,also most of those which it is the object of this book to treat of.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the ages of aristocracy which preceded our own, there were private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons of great power, and a social authority of extreme weakness. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"outline of society itself was not easily discernible, and constantly","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confounded with the different powers by which the community was ruled.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The principal efforts of the men of those times were required to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strengthen, aggrandize, and secure the supreme power; and on the other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hand, to circumscribe individual independence within narrower limits,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and to subject private interests to the interests of the public. Other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,perils and other cares await the men of our age. Amongst the greater,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part of modern nations, the government, whatever may be its origin, its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitution, or its name, has become almost omnipotent, and private","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"persons are falling, more and more, into the lowest stage of weakness","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and dependence. In olden society everything was different; unity and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,uniformity were nowhere to be met with. In modern society everything,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"threatens to become so much alike, that the peculiar characteristics of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,each individual will soon be entirely lost in the general aspect of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,world. Our forefathers were ever prone to make an improper use of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"notion, that private rights ought to be respected; and we are naturally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prone on the other hand to exaggerate the idea that the interest of a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,private individual ought always to bend to the interest of the many. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,political world is metamorphosed: new remedies must henceforth be sought,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for new disorders. To lay down extensive, but distinct and settled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"limits, to the action of the government; to confer certain rights on","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"private persons, and to secure to them the undisputed enjoyment of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rights; to enable individual man to maintain whatever independence,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strength, and original power he still possesses; to raise him by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"side of society at large, and uphold him in that position--these appear","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to me the main objects of legislators in the ages upon which we are now,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,entering. It would seem as if the rulers of our time sought only to use,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men in order to make things great; I wish that they would try a little,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more to make great men; that they would set less value on the work, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,more upon the workman; that they would never forget that a nation cannot,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"long remain strong when every man belonging to it is individually weak,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and that no form or combination of social polity has yet been devised,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to make an energetic people out of a community of pusillanimous and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enfeebled citizens.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I trace amongst our contemporaries two contrary notions which are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,equally injurious. One set of men can perceive nothing in the principle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of equality but the anarchical tendencies which it engenders: they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dread their own free agency--they fear themselves. Other thinkers, less","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"numerous but more enlightened, take a different view: besides that track","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which starts from the principle of equality to terminate in anarchy,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they have at last discovered the road which seems to lead men to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,inevitable servitude. They shape their souls beforehand to this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"necessary condition; and, despairing of remaining free, they already","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,do obeisance in their hearts to the master who is soon to appear. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"former abandon freedom, because they think it dangerous; the latter,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,because they hold it to be impossible. If I had entertained the latter,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"conviction, I should not have written this book, but I should have","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,confined myself to deploring in secret the destiny of mankind. I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sought to point out the dangers to which the principle of equality,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exposes the independence of man, because I firmly believe that these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dangers are the most formidable, as well as the least foreseen, of all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,those which futurity holds in store: but I do not think that they are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,insurmountable. The men who live in the democratic ages upon which we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are entering have naturally a taste for independence: they are naturally,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"impatient of regulation, and they are wearied by the permanence even of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the condition they themselves prefer. They are fond of power; but they,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are prone to despise and hate those who wield it, and they easily elude","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its grasp by their own mobility and insignificance. These propensities,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will always manifest themselves, because they originate in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"groundwork of society, which will undergo no change: for a long time","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they will prevent the establishment of any despotism, and they will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,furnish fresh weapons to each succeeding generation which shall struggle,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in favor of the liberty of mankind. Let us then look forward to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,future with that salutary fear which makes men keep watch and ward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for freedom, not with that faint and idle terror which depresses and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,enervates the heart.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Chapter VIII: General Survey Of The Subject,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Before I close forever the theme that has detained me so long, I would","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fain take a parting survey of all the various characteristics of modern,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"society, and appreciate at last the general influence to be exercised by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the principle of equality upon the fate of mankind; but I am stopped,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by the difficulty of the task, and in presence of so great an object my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sight is troubled, and my reason fails. The society of the modern world","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which I have sought to delineate, and which I seek to judge, has but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,just come into existence. Time has not yet shaped it into perfect form:,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the great revolution by which it has been created is not yet over: and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amidst the occurrences of our time, it is almost impossible to discern","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"what will pass away with the revolution itself, and what will survive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its close. The world which is rising into existence is still half,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,encumbered by the remains of the world which is waning into decay; and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amidst the vast perplexity of human affairs, none can say how much of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ancient institutions and former manners will remain, or how much will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,completely disappear. Although the revolution which is taking place in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the social condition, the laws, the opinions, and the feelings of men,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is still very far from being terminated, yet its results already admit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of no comparison with anything that the world has ever before witnessed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I go back from age to age up to the remotest antiquity; but I find no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,parallel to what is occurring before my eyes: as the past has ceased to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"throw its light upon the future, the mind of man wanders in obscurity.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nevertheless, in the midst of a prospect so wide, so novel and so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"confused, some of the more prominent characteristics may already be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discerned and pointed out. The good things and the evils of life are,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more equally distributed in the world: great wealth tends to disappear,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the number of small fortunes to increase; desires and gratifications,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are multiplied, but extraordinary prosperity and irremediable penury are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"alike unknown. The sentiment of ambition is universal, but the scope","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of ambition is seldom vast. Each individual stands apart in solitary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"weakness; but society at large is active, provident, and powerful: the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"performances of private persons are insignificant, those of the State","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immense. There is little energy of character; but manners are mild, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,laws humane. If there be few instances of exalted heroism or of virtues,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the highest, brightest, and purest temper, men's habits are regular,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"violence is rare, and cruelty almost unknown. Human existence becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"longer, and property more secure: life is not adorned with brilliant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trophies, but it is extremely easy and tranquil. Few pleasures are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,either very refined or very coarse; and highly polished manners are as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"uncommon as great brutality of tastes. Neither men of great learning,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nor extremely ignorant communities, are to be met with; genius becomes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more rare, information more diffused. The human mind is impelled by the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"small efforts of all mankind combined together, not by the strenuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"activity of certain men. There is less perfection, but more abundance,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in all the productions of the arts. The ties of race, of rank, and of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,country are relaxed; the great bond of humanity is strengthened. If,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I endeavor to find out the most general and the most prominent of all,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these different characteristics, I shall have occasion to perceive, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,what is taking place in men's fortunes manifests itself under a thousand,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,other forms. Almost all extremes are softened or blunted: all that was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most prominent is superseded by some mean term, at once less lofty and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"less low, less brilliant and less obscure, than what before existed in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the world.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"When I survey this countless multitude of beings, shaped in each other's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"likeness, amidst whom nothing rises and nothing falls, the sight of such","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"universal uniformity saddens and chills me, and I am tempted to regret","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that state of society which has ceased to be. When the world was full of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"men of great importance and extreme insignificance, of great wealth and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"extreme poverty, of great learning and extreme ignorance, I turned aside","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the latter to fix my observation on the former alone, who gratified","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,my sympathies. But I admit that this gratification arose from my own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,weakness: it is because I am unable to see at once all that is around,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"me, that I am allowed thus to select and separate the objects of my","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,predilection from among so many others. Such is not the case with that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almighty and eternal Being whose gaze necessarily includes the whole of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"created things, and who surveys distinctly, though at once, mankind and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man. We may naturally believe that it is not the singular prosperity of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the few, but the greater well-being of all, which is most pleasing in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the sight of the Creator and Preserver of men. What appears to me to be,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man's decline, is to His eye advancement; what afflicts me is acceptable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to Him. A state of equality is perhaps less elevated, but it is more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,just; and its justice constitutes its greatness and its beauty. I would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"strive then to raise myself to this point of the divine contemplation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and thence to view and to judge the concerns of men.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"No man, upon the earth, can as yet affirm absolutely and generally,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,that the new state of the world is better than its former one; but it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is already easy to perceive that this state is different. Some vices,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and some virtues were so inherent in the constitution of an aristocratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nation, and are so opposite to the character of a modern people, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they can never be infused into it; some good tendencies and some bad,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"propensities which were unknown to the former, are natural to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,latter; some ideas suggest themselves spontaneously to the imagination,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the one, which are utterly repugnant to the mind of the other. They","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"are like two distinct orders of human beings, each of which has its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own merits and defects, its own advantages and its own evils. Care","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"must therefore be taken not to judge the state of society, which is now","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"coming into existence, by notions derived from a state of society","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which no longer exists; for as these states of society are exceedingly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"different in their structure, they cannot be submitted to a just or fair","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,comparison. It would be scarcely more reasonable to require of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,own contemporaries the peculiar virtues which originated in the social,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"condition of their forefathers, since that social condition is itself","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fallen, and has drawn into one promiscuous ruin the good and evil which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,belonged to it.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But as yet these things are imperfectly understood. I find that a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,number of my contemporaries undertake to make a certain selection from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"amongst the institutions, the opinions, and the ideas which originated","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in the aristocratic constitution of society as it was: a portion of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these elements they would willingly relinquish, but they would keep the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,remainder and transplant them into their new world. I apprehend that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,such men are wasting their time and their strength in virtuous,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but unprofitable efforts. The object is not to retain the peculiar,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"advantages which the inequality of conditions bestows upon mankind, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to secure the new benefits which equality may supply. We have not to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seek to make ourselves like our progenitors, but to strive to work out","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that species of greatness and happiness which is our own. For myself,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"who now look back from this extreme limit of my task, and discover from","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afar, but at once, the various objects which have attracted my more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"attentive investigation upon my way, I am full of apprehensions and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of hopes. I perceive mighty dangers which it is possible to ward,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,off--mighty evils which may be avoided or alleviated; and I cling with,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a firmer hold to the belief, that for democratic nations to be virtuous","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and prosperous they require but to will it. I am aware that many of my,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemporaries maintain that nations are never their own masters,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"here below, and that they necessarily obey some insurmountable and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unintelligent power, arising from anterior events, from their race, or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from the soil and climate of their country. Such principles are false,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and cowardly; such principles can never produce aught but feeble men,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and pusillanimous nations. Providence has not created mankind entirely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,independent or entirely free. It is true that around every man a fatal,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"circle is traced, beyond which he cannot pass; but within the wide","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"verge of that circle he is powerful and free: as it is with man, so with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,communities. The nations of our time cannot prevent the conditions of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men from becoming equal; but it depends upon themselves whether the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principle of equality is to lead them to servitude or freedom, to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"knowledge or barbarism, to prosperity or to wretchedness.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,undertaken at the expense of Congress by Major Long. This traveller,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"particularly mentions, on the subject of the great American desert, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a line may be drawn nearly parallel to the 20th degree of longitude *a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"(meridian of Washington), beginning from the Red River and ending at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the River Platte. From this imaginary line to the Rocky Mountains, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bound the valley of the Mississippi on the west, lie immense plains,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are almost entirely covered with sand, incapable of cultivation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or scattered over with masses of granite. In summer, these plains are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"quite destitute of water, and nothing is to be seen on them but herds of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,buffaloes and wild horses. Some hordes of Indians are also found,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"there, but in no great numbers. Major Long was told that in travelling","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,northwards from the River Platte you find the same desert lying,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly on the left; but he was unable to ascertain the truth of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"report. However worthy of confidence may be the narrative of Major Long,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it must be remembered that he only passed through the country of which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he speaks, without deviating widely from the line which he had traced","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,out for his journey.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"profusion of climbing plants, of which the flora of the Antilles alone","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,presents us with forty different species. Among the most graceful of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"these shrubs is the passion-flower, which, according to Descourtiz,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"grows with such luxuriance in the Antilles, as to climb trees by means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the tendrils with which it is provided, and form moving bowers of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rich and elegant festoons, decorated with blue and purple flowers, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fragrant with perfume. The Mimosa scandens (Acacia a grandes gousses) is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"The languages which are spoken by the Indians of America, from the Pole","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to Cape Horn, are said to be all formed upon the same model, and subject","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to the same grammatical rules; whence it may fairly be concluded that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all the Indian nations sprang from the same stock. Each tribe of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the American continent speaks a different dialect; but the number of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"languages, properly so called, is very small, a fact which tends to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prove that the nations of the New World had not a very remote origin.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Moreover, the languages of America have a great degree of regularity,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,from which it seems probable that the tribes which employ them had not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undergone any great revolutions, or been incorporated voluntarily or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by constraint, with foreign nations. For it is generally the union of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,several languages into one which produces grammatical irregularities. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is not long since the American languages, especially those of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"North, first attracted the serious attention of philologists, when the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discovery was made that this idiom of a barbarous people was the product,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of a complicated system of ideas and very learned combinations. These,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"languages were found to be very rich, and great pains had been taken","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,at their formation to render them agreeable to the ear. The grammatical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"system of the Americans differs from all others in several points, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"especially in the following:--Some nations of Europe, amongst","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"others the Germans, have the power of combining at pleasure different","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expressions, and thus giving a complex sense to certain words. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Indians have given a most surprising extension to this power, so as to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arrive at the means of connecting a great number of ideas with a single,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,term. This will be easily understood with the help of an example quoted,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"by Mr. Duponceau, in the ""Memoirs of the Philosophical Society of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"America"": A Delaware woman playing with a cat or a young dog, says","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this writer, is heard to pronounce the word kuligatschis, which is thus","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"composed: k is the sign of the second person, and signifies ""thou"" or","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""thy""; uli is a part of the word wulit, which signifies ""beautiful,""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""pretty""; gat is another fragment, of the word wichgat, which means","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""paw""; and, lastly, schis is a diminutive giving the idea of smallness.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Thus in one word the Indian woman has expressed ""Thy pretty little paw.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Take another example of the felicity with which the savages of America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have composed their words. A young man of Delaware is called pilape.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This word is formed from pilsit, ""chaste,"" ""innocent""; and lenape,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""man""; viz., ""man in his purity and innocence."" This facility of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,combining words is most remarkable in the strange formation of their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"verbs. The most complex action is often expressed by a single verb,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which serves to convey all the shades of an idea by the modification,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of its construction. Those who may wish to examine more in detail this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"subject, which I have only glanced at superficially, should read:--","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"See in Charlevoix, vol. i. p. 235, the history of the first war which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the French inhabitants of Canada carried on, in 1610, against the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Iroquois. The latter, armed with bows and arrows, offered a desperate","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,resistance to the French and their allies. Charlevoix is not a great,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"painter, yet he exhibits clearly enough, in this narrative, the contrast","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"between the European manners and those of savages, as well as the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different way in which the two races of men understood the sense of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"honor. When the French, says he, seized upon the beaver-skins which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"covered the Indians who had fallen, the Hurons, their allies, were","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,greatly offended at this proceeding; but without hesitation they set,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to work in their usual manner, inflicting horrid cruelties upon the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prisoners, and devouring one of those who had been killed, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,made the Frenchmen shudder. The barbarians prided themselves upon a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"scrupulousness which they were surprised at not finding in our nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and could not understand that there was less to reprehend in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stripping of dead bodies than in the devouring of their flesh like wild,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"beasts. Charlevoix, in another place (vol. i. p. 230), thus describes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the first torture of which Champlain was an eyewitness, and the return","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the Hurons into their own village. Having proceeded about eight,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"leagues, says he, our allies halted; and having singled out one of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their captives, they reproached him with all the cruelties which he","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,had practised upon the warriors of their nation who had fallen into his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hands, and told him that he might expect to be treated in like manner;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"adding, that if he had any spirit he would prove it by singing. He","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"immediately chanted forth his death-song, and then his war-song, and all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the songs he knew, ""but in a very mournful strain,"" says Champlain, who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was not then aware that all savage music has a melancholy character. The,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tortures which succeeded, accompanied by all the horrors which we shall","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"mention hereafter, terrified the French, who made every effort to put a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"stop to them, but in vain. The following night, one of the Hurons having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dreamt that they were pursued, the retreat was changed to a real flight,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and the savages never stopped until they were out of the reach of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"danger. The moment they perceived the cabins of their own village, they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cut themselves long sticks, to which they fastened the scalps which had","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fallen to their share, and carried them in triumph. At this sight, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"women swam to the canoes, where they received the bloody scalps from the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hands of their husbands, and tied them round their necks. The warriors","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,offered one of these horrible trophies to Champlain; they also presented,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him with some bows and arrows--the only spoils of the Iroquois which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,they had ventured to seize--entreating him to show them to the King,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of France. Champlain lived a whole winter quite alone among these,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"barbarians, without being under any alarm for his person or property.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Sabbath. We give the preamble and the principal articles of this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"law, which is worthy of the reader's attention: ""Whereas,"" says the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"legislator, ""the observation of the Sunday is an affair of public","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"men to reflect upon the duties of life, and the errors to which human","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"nature is liable, and provides for the public and private worship of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"God, the creator and governor of the universe, and for the performance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of such acts of charity as are the ornament and comfort of Christian,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"societies:--Whereas irreligious or light-minded persons, forgetting the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"confer on society, are known to profane its sanctity, by following their","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,pleasures or their affairs; this way of acting being contrary to their,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"own interest as Christians, and calculated to annoy those who do not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"(Same collection, vol. ii. p. 405.) Similar enactments exist in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The laws we quote from are of recent date; but they are unintelligible,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,that in our days the penal part of these laws is very rarely applied.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Laws preserve their inflexibility, long after the manners of a nation","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,nothing strikes a foreigner on his arrival in America more forcibly,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than the regard paid to the Sabbath. There is one, in particular, of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the large American cities, in which all social movements begin to be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,suspended even on Saturday evening. You traverse its streets at the hour,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at which you expect men in the middle of life to be engaged in business,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and young people in pleasure; and you meet with solitude and silence.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Not only have all ceased to work, but they appear to have ceased to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exist. Neither the movements of industry are heard, nor the accents of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"joy, nor even the confused murmur which arises from the midst of a great","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,city. Chains are hung across the streets in the neighborhood of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,churches; the half-closed shutters of the houses scarcely admit a ray,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of sun into the dwellings of the citizens. Now and then you perceive a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,solitary individual who glides silently along the deserted streets and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"lanes. Next day, at early dawn, the rolling of carriages, the noise of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"hammers, the cries of the population, begin to make themselves heard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,again. The city is awake. An eager crowd hastens towards the resort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commerce and industry; everything around you bespeaks motion, bustle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,hurry. A feverish activity succeeds to the lethargic stupor of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"Papers, and other authentic Documents, intended as Materials for a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"History of the United States of America,"" by Ebenezer Hasard. The first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"volume of this compilation, which was printed at Philadelphia in 1792,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contains a literal copy of all the charters granted by the Crown of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"England to the emigrants, as well as the principal acts of the colonial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"governments, during the commencement of their existence. Amongst other","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"authentic documents, we here find a great many relating to the affairs","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of New England and Virginia during this period. The second volume is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost entirely devoted to the acts of the Confederation of 1643. This,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"federal compact, which was entered into by the colonies of New England","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with the view of resisting the Indians, was the first instance of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,union afforded by the Anglo-Americans. There were besides many other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"sometymes Governor in those Countryes, and Admirall of New England"";","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,printed at London in 1627. The work is adorned with curious maps and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,engravings of the time when it appeared; the narrative extends from the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,year 1584 to 1626. Smith's work is highly and deservedly esteemed.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The author was one of the most celebrated adventurers of a period of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"remarkable adventure; his book breathes that ardor for discovery, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"spirit of enterprise, which characterized the men of his time, when","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the manners of chivalry were united to zeal for commerce, and made","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,subservient to the acquisition of wealth. But Captain Smith is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most remarkable for uniting to the virtues which characterized his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,contemporaries several qualities to which they were generally strangers;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his style is simple and concise, his narratives bear the stamp of truth,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and his descriptions are free from false ornament. This author throws,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,most valuable light upon the state and condition of the Indians at the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time when North America was first discovered.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"The second historian to consult is Beverley, who commences his narrative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with the year 1585, and ends it with 1700. The first part of his book","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"contains historical documents, properly so called, relative to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infancy of the colony. The second affords a most curious picture of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,state of the Indians at this remote period. The third conveys very clear,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ideas concerning the manners, social conditions, laws, and political","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,customs of the Virginians in the author's lifetime. Beverley was a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"native of Virginia, which occasions him to say at the beginning of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his book, that he entreats his readers not to exercise their critical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"severity upon it, since, having been born in the Indies, he does not","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"aspire to purity of language. Notwithstanding this colonial modesty, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,author shows throughout his book the impatience with which he endures,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the supremacy of the mother-country. In this work of Beverley are also,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,found numerous traces of that spirit of civil liberty which animated the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,English colonies of America at the time when he wrote. He also shows the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dissensions which existed among them, and retarded their independence.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Beverley detests his Catholic neighbors of Maryland even more than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he hates the English government: his style is simple, his narrative","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"interesting, and apparently trustworthy.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I saw in America another work which ought to be consulted, entitled ""The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"History of Virginia,"" by William Stith. This book affords some curious","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"details, but I thought it long and diffuse. The most ancient as well as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the best document to be consulted on the history of Carolina, is a work","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in small quarto, entitled ""The History of Carolina,"" by John Lawson,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"printed at London in 1718. This work contains, in the first part, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"journey of discovery in the west of Carolina; the account of which,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"given in the form of a journal, is in general confused and superficial;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but it contains a very striking description of the mortality caused,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,among the savages of that time both by the smallpox and the immoderate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,use of brandy; with a curious picture of the corruption of manners,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"prevalent amongst them, which was increased by the presence of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Europeans. The second part of Lawson's book is taken up with a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"description of the physical condition of Carolina, and its productions.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the third part, the author gives an interesting account of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manners, customs, and government of the Indians at that period. There is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a good deal of talent and originality in this part of the work.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Lawson concludes his history with a copy of the charter granted to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Carolinas in the reign of Charles II. The general tone of this work is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"light, and often licentious, forming a perfect contrast to the solemn","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,style of the works published at the same period in New England. Lawson's,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"history is extremely scarce in America, and cannot be procured in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Europe. There is, however, a copy of it in the Royal Library at Paris.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"From the southern extremity of the United States, I pass at once to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,northern limit; as the intermediate space was not peopled till a later,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"period. I must first point out a very curious compilation, entitled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society,"" printed for the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"first time at Boston in 1792, and reprinted in 1806. The collection of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which I speak, and which is continued to the present day, contains a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,great number of very valuable documents relating to the history of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,different States in New England. Among them are letters which have never,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been published, and authentic pieces which had been buried in provincial","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"archives. The whole work of Gookin, concerning the Indians, is inserted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,there.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I have mentioned several times in the chapter to which this note,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"relates, the work of Nathaniel Norton entitled ""New England's Memorial"";","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sufficiently, perhaps, to prove that it deserves the attention of those","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,who would be conversant with the history of New England. This book is in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"octavo, and was reprinted at Boston in 1826.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The most valuable and important authority which exists upon the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"history of New England, is the work of the Rev. Cotton Mather, entitled","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Magnalia Christi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of New","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"England, 1620-1698, 2 vols. 8vo, reprinted at Hartford, United States,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in 1820."" *b The author divided his work into seven books. The first","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,presents the history of the events which prepared and brought about the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,establishment of New England. The second contains the lives of the first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,governors and chief magistrates who presided over the country. The third,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is devoted to the lives and labors of the evangelical ministers who,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"during the same period, had the care of souls. In the fourth the author","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,relates the institution and progress of the University of Cambridge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,(Massachusetts). In the fifth he describes the principles and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,discipline of the Church of New England. The sixth is taken up in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"retracing certain facts, which, in the opinion of Mather, prove the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,merciful interposition of Providence in behalf of the inhabitants of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"New England. Lastly, in the seventh, the author gives an account of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the heresies and the troubles to which the Church of New England was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,exposed. Cotton Mather was an evangelical minister who was born at,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Boston, and passed his life there. His narratives are distinguished by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same ardor and religious zeal which led to the foundation of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,colonies of New England. Traces of bad taste sometimes occur in his,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"manner of writing; but he interests, because he is full of enthusiasm.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"He is often intolerant, still oftener credulous, but he never betrays","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"an intention to deceive. Sometimes his book contains fine passages, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"true and profound reflections, such as the following:--","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Before the arrival of the Puritans,"" says he (vol. i. chap. iv.),","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""there were more than a few attempts of the English to people and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,improve the parts of New England which were to the northward of New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Plymouth; but the designs of those attempts being aimed no higher,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"than the advancement of some worldly interests, a constant series of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disasters has confounded them, until there was a plantation erected upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the nobler designs of Christianity: and that plantation though it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"has had more adversaries than perhaps any one upon earth, yet, having","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"obtained help from God, it continues to this day."" Mather occasionally","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,relieves the austerity of his descriptions with images full of tender,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,feeling: after having spoken of an English lady whose religious ardor,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"had brought her to America with her husband, and who soon after sank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"under the fatigues and privations of exile, he adds, ""As for her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"virtuous husband, Isaac Johnson,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,     He tryed,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"     To live without her, liked it not, and dyed.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,1702.],"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Mather's work gives an admirable picture of the time and country which,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,he describes. In his account of the motives which led the Puritans to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"seek an asylum beyond seas, he says:--""The God of Heaven served, as it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were, a summons upon the spirits of his people in the English nation,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,stirring up the spirits of thousands which never saw the faces of each,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"other, with a most unanimous inclination to leave all the pleasant","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"accommodations of their native country, and go over a terrible","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ocean, into a more terrible desert, for the pure enjoyment of all his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ordinances. It is now reasonable that, before we pass any further,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the reasons of his undertaking should be more exactly made known,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unto posterity, especially unto the posterity of those that were the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"undertakers, lest they come at length to forget and neglect the true","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,interest of New England. Wherefore I shall now transcribe some of them,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from a manuscript, wherein they were then tendered unto consideration:","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""General Considerations for the Plantation of New England","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Secondly, All other Churches of Europe have been brought under","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,desolations; and it may be feared that the like judgments are coming,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,upon us; and who knows but God hath provided this place to be a refuge,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,for many whom he means to save out of the general destruction?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"base than the earth he treads upon; children, neighbours, and friends,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"especially the poor, are counted the greatest burdens, which, if things","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"were right, would be the chiefest of earthly blessings.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""Fourthly, We are grown to that intemperance in all excess of riot, as","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"to pass, that all arts and trades are carried in that deceitful manner","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and unrighteous course, as it is almost impossible for a good upright","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,give more life unto the faith of God's people in their prayers for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"plantation, and also to encourage others to join the more willingly in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Further on, when he declares the principles of the Church of New England","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"with respect to morals, Mather inveighs with violence against the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"custom of drinking healths at table, which he denounces as a pagan and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,abominable practice. He proscribes with the same rigor all ornaments for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the hair used by the female sex, as well as their custom of having the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,arms and neck uncovered. In another part of his work he relates several,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,instances of witchcraft which had alarmed New England. It is plain that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the visible action of the devil in the affairs of this world appeared to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,him an incontestable and evident fact.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"This work of Cotton Mather displays, in many places, the spirit of civil","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,liberty and political independence which characterized the times in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which he lived. Their principles respecting government are discoverable,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at every page. Thus, for instance, the inhabitants of Massachusetts, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the year 1630, ten years after the foundation of Plymouth, are found to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,have devoted Pound 400 sterling to the establishment of the University,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of Cambridge. In passing from the general documents relative to the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,history of New England to those which describe the several States,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"comprised within its limits, I ought first to notice ""The History of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Colony of Massachusetts,"" by Hutchinson, Lieutenant-Governor of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Massachusetts Province, 2 vols. 8vo. The history of Hutchinson, which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have several times quoted in the chapter to which this note relates,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"commences in the year 1628, and ends in 1750. Throughout the work there","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is a striking air of truth and the greatest simplicity of style: it,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is full of minute details. The best history to consult concerning,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Connecticut is that of Benjamin Trumbull, entitled ""A Complete History","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of Connecticut, Civil and Ecclesiastical,"" 1630-1764, 2 vols. 8vo,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,printed in 1818 at New Haven. This history contains a clear and calm,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,account of all the events which happened in Connecticut during the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"period given in the title. The author drew from the best sources, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his narrative bears the stamp of truth. All that he says of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,early days of Connecticut is extremely curious. See especially the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Constitution of 1639, vol. i. ch. vi. p. 100; and also the Penal Laws of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Connecticut, vol. i. ch. vii. p. 123.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""The History of New Hampshire,"" by Jeremy Belknap, is a work held in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"merited estimation. It was printed at Boston in 1792, in 2 vols.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,8vo. The third chapter of the first volume is particularly worthy of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,attention for the valuable details it affords on the political and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"religious principles of the Puritans, on the causes of their emigration,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and on their laws. The following curious quotation is given from a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sermon delivered in 1663:--""It concerneth New England always to remember","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that they are a plantation religious, not a plantation of trade. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"profession of the purity of doctrine, worship, and discipline, is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"written upon her forehead. Let merchants, and such as are increasing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cent. per cent., remember this, that worldly gain was not the end and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"design of the people of New England, but religion. And if any man among","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"us make religion as twelve, and the world as thirteen, such an one hath","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"not the spirit of a true New Englishman."" The reader of Belknap will","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"find in his work more general ideas, and more strength of thought, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are to be met with in the American historians even to the present day.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Among the Central States which deserve our attention for their remote,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"origin, New York and Pennsylvania are the foremost. The best history","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"we have of the former is entitled ""A History of New York,"" by William","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Smith, printed at London in 1757. Smith gives us important details of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"February 23, 1786. (See Revised Statutes, vol. iii. Appendix, p. 48.) It","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,has since then been adopted in the Revised Statutes of the same State.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,At the present day this law holds good throughout the whole of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"United States, with the exception of the State of Vermont, where the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"male heir inherits a double portion. (Kent's ""Commentaries,"" vol. iv. p.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"370.) Mr. Kent, in the same work, vol. iv. p. 1-22, gives a historical","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,account of American legislation on the subject of entail: by this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"we learn that, previous to the Revolution, the colonies followed the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"English law of entail. Estates tail were abolished in Virginia in 1776,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"on a motion of Mr. Jefferson. They were suppressed in New York in 1786,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and have since been abolished in North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Georgia, and Missouri. In Vermont, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and Louisiana, entail was never introduced. Those States which thought","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"proper to preserve the English law of entail, modified it in such a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"way as to deprive it of its most aristocratic tendencies. ""Our general","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"principles on the subject of government,"" says Mr. Kent, ""tend to favor","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the free circulation of property.""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It cannot fail to strike the French reader who studies the law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of inheritance, that on these questions the French legislation is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,infinitely more democratic even than the American. The American law,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"makes an equal division of the father's property, but only in the case","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his will not being known; ""for every man,"" says the law, ""in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"State of New York (Revised Statutes, vol. iii. Appendix, p. 51), has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"entire liberty, power, and authority, to dispose of his property by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"will, to leave it entire, or divided in favor of any persons he chooses","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"as his heirs, provided he do not leave it to a political body or any","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"corporation."" The French law obliges the testator to divide his property","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equally, or nearly so, among his heirs. Most of the American republics","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still admit of entails, under certain restrictions; but the French law","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prohibits entail in all cases. If the social condition of the Americans,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is more democratic than that of the French, the laws of the latter are","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the most democratic of the two. This may be explained more easily than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"at first appears to be the case. In France, democracy is still occupied","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,Existed In 1832,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,All the States agree in granting the right of voting at the age of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,twenty-one. In all of them it is necessary to have resided for a certain,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time in the district where the vote is given. This period varies from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,three months to two years.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,As to the qualification: in the State of Massachusetts it is necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to have an income of Pound 3 or a capital of Pound 60. In Rhode Island,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,a man must possess landed property to the amount of $133.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In Connecticut, he must have a property which gives an income of $17. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,year of service in the militia also gives the elective privilege.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In New Jersey, an elector must have a property of Pound 50 a year.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In South Carolina and Maryland, the elector must possess fifty acres of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,land.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In Tennessee, he must possess some property.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In the States of Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Delaware, New York, the only necessary qualification for voting is that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of paying the taxes; and in most of the States, to serve in the militia","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is equivalent to the payment of taxes. In Maine and New Hampshire any,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,man can vote who is not on the pauper list.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Lastly, in the States of Missouri, Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Indiana, Kentucky, and Vermont, the conditions of voting have no","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,reference to the property of the elector.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,I believe there is no other State besides that of North Carolina in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,which different conditions are applied to the voting for the Senate and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the electing the House of Representatives. The electors of the former,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in this case, should possess in property fifty acres of land; to vote","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,It is incorrect to assert that centralization was produced by the French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Revolution; the revolution brought it to perfection, but did not create","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. The mania for centralization and government regulations dates from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the time when jurists began to take a share in the government, in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,time of Philippele-Bel; ever since which period they have been on the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"increase. In the year 1775, M. de Malesherbes, speaking in the name of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the Cour des Aides, said to Louis XIV:-- *d","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"[Footnote d: See ""Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire du Droit Public de","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"la France en matiere d'impots,"" p. 654, printed at Brussels in 1779.]","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,""". . . Every corporation and every community of citizens retained the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,right of administering its own affairs; a right which not only forms,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part of the primitive constitution of the kingdom, but has a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"still higher origin; for it is the right of nature, and of reason.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Nevertheless, your subjects, Sire, have been deprived of it; and we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,cannot refrain from saying that in this respect your government has,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,fallen into puerile extremes. From the time when powerful ministers,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,made it a political principle to prevent the convocation of a national,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"assembly, one consequence has succeeded another, until the deliberations","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of the inhabitants of a village are declared null when they have not,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"been authorized by the Intendant. Of course, if the community has an","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expensive undertaking to carry through, it must remain under the control","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the sub-delegate of the Intendant, and, consequently, follow the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"plan he proposes, employ his favorite workmen, pay them according to his","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"pleasure; and if an action at law is deemed necessary, the Intendant's","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,permission must be obtained. The cause must be pleaded before this first,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tribunal, previous to its being carried into a public court; and if the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"opinion of the Intendant is opposed to that of the inhabitants, or if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their adversary enjoys his favor, the community is deprived of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"power of defending its rights. Such are the means, Sire, which have been","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exerted to extinguish the municipal spirit in France; and to stifle, if","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"possible, the opinions of the citizens. The nation may be said to lie","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"under an interdict, and to be in wardship under guardians."" What could","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be said more to the purpose at the present day, when the Revolution has","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,achieved what are called its victories in centralization?,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"In 1789, Jefferson wrote from Paris to one of his friends:--""There is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no country where the mania for over-governing has taken deeper root than,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in France, or been the source of greater mischief."" (Letter to Madison,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"August 28, 1789.) The fact is, that for several centuries past the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,central power of France has done everything it could to extend central,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,administration; it has acknowledged no other limits than its own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,strength. The central power to which the Revolution gave birth made more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"rapid advances than any of its predecessors, because it was stronger","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and wiser than they had been; Louis XIV committed the welfare of such,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,communities to the caprice of an intendant; Napoleon left them to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"that of the Minister. The same principle governed both, though its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The immutability of the constitution of France is a necessary,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequence of the laws of that country. To begin with the most,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"important of all the laws, that which decides the order of succession to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the throne; what can be more immutable in its principle than a political,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"order founded upon the natural succession of father to son? In 1814,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Louis XVIII had established the perpetual law of hereditary succession,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in favor of his own family. The individuals who regulated the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,consequences of the Revolution of 1830 followed his example; they merely,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,established the perpetuity of the law in favor of another family. In,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"this respect they imitated the Chancellor Meaupou, who, when he erected","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the new Parliament upon the ruins of the old, took care to declare in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the same ordinance that the rights of the new magistrates should be as,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"inalienable as those of their predecessors had been. The laws of 1830,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"like those of 1814, point out no way of changing the constitution: and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it is evident that the ordinary means of legislation are insufficient,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"for this purpose. As the King, the Peers, and the Deputies, all derive","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their authority from the constitution, these three powers united cannot","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,alter a law by virtue of which alone they govern. Out of the pale of the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"constitution they are nothing: where, when, could they take their stand","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to effect a change in its provisions? The alternative is clear: either,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their efforts are powerless against the charter, which continues to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exist in spite of them, in which case they only reign in the name of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"charter; or they succeed in changing the charter, and then, the law by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they existed being annulled, they themselves cease to exist.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"By destroying the charter, they destroy themselves. This is much more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"evident in the laws of 1830 than in those of 1814. In 1814, the royal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,prerogative took its stand above and beyond the constitution; but in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"1830, it was avowedly created by, and dependent on, the constitution. A","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"part, therefore, of the French constitution is immutable, because it is","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,united to the destiny of a family; and the body of the constitution is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"equally immutable, because there appear to be no legal means of changing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it. These remarks are not applicable to England. That country having no,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"that Parliament can do everything except making a woman a man, or a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man a woman."" Blackstone expresses himself more in detail, if not more","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"energetically, than Delolme, in the following terms:--""The power and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"jurisdiction of Parliament, says Sir Edward Coke (4 Inst. 36), 'is so","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined, either for causes","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"or persons, within any bounds.' And of this High Court, he adds, may be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"truly said, 'Si antiquitatem spectes, est vetustissima; si dignitatem,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"est honoratissima; si jurisdictionem, est capacissima.' It hath","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"sovereign and uncontrollable authority in the making, confirming,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"ecclesiastical or temporal; civil, military, maritime, or criminal; this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"being the place where that absolute despotic power which must, in all","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"governments, reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new-model the succession to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the Crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII and William III. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,can alter the established religion of the land; as was done in a variety,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII and his three children. It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,and of parliaments themselves; as was done by the Act of Union and the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"short, do everything that is not naturally impossible to be done; and,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,the Union; but there is always greater facility and less danger in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,supporting a maritime than a continental war. Maritime warfare only,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,requires one species of effort. A commercial people which consents to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"furnish its government with the necessary funds, is sure to possess a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"fleet. And it is far easier to induce a nation to part with its money,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"almost unconsciously, than to reconcile it to sacrifices of men and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"personal efforts. Moreover, defeat by sea rarely compromises the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,existence or independence of the people which endures it. As for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"continental wars, it is evident that the nations of Europe cannot be","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,formidable in this way to the American Union. It would be very difficult,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,The Federal Constitution has introduced the jury into the tribunals of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the Union in the same way as the States had introduced it into their own,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,several courts; but as it has not established any fixed rules for the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"choice of jurors, the federal courts select them from the ordinary jury","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,list which each State makes for itself. The laws of the States must,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,therefore be examined for the theory of the formation of juries.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"See Story's ""Commentaries on the Constitution,"" B. iii. chap. 38, p.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"654-659; Sergeant's ""Constitutional Law,"" p. 165. See also the Federal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Laws of the years 1789, 1800, and 1802, upon the subject. For the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,purpose of thoroughly understanding the American principles with respect,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to the formation of juries, I examined the laws of States at a distance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from one another, and the following observations were the result of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"my inquiries. In America, all the citizens who exercise the elective","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,franchise have the right of serving upon a jury. The great State of New,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"York, however, has made a slight difference between the two privileges,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,but in a spirit quite contrary to that of the laws of France; for in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,State of New York there are fewer persons eligible as jurymen than there,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are electors. It may be said in general that the right of forming part,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of a jury, like the right of electing representatives, is open to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"all the citizens: the exercise of this right, however, is not put","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,indiscriminately into any hands. Every year a body of municipal or,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"county magistrates--called ""selectmen"" in New England, ""supervisors""","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in New York, ""trustees"" in Ohio, and ""sheriffs of the parish"" in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Louisiana--choose for each county a certain number of citizens who have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the right of serving as jurymen, and who are supposed to be capable","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of exercising their functions. These magistrates, being themselves","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"elective, excite no distrust; their powers, like those of most","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"republican magistrates, are very extensive and very arbitrary, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,frequently make use of them to remove unworthy or incompetent jurymen.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The names of the jurymen thus chosen are transmitted to the County,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,Court; and the jury who have to decide any affair are drawn by lot from,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the whole list of names. The Americans have contrived in every way to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"make the common people eligible to the jury, and to render the service","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as little onerous as possible. The sessions are held in the chief town,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of every county, and the jury are indemnified for their attendance","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,either by the State or the parties concerned. They receive in general a,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dollar per day, besides their travelling expenses. In America, the being","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"placed upon the jury is looked upon as a burden, but it is a burden","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which is very supportable. See Brevard's ""Digest of the Public Statute","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,If we attentively examine the constitution of the jury as introduced,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"into civil proceedings in England, we shall readily perceive that the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,jurors are under the immediate control of the judge. It is true that the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"verdict of the jury, in civil as well as in criminal cases, comprises","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the question of fact and the question of right in the same reply;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,thus--a house is claimed by Peter as having been purchased by him: this,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,is the fact to be decided. The defendant puts in a plea of incompetency,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,on the part of the vendor: this is the legal question to be resolved.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,But the jury do not enjoy the same character of infallibility in civil,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"""The bell which the pioneers hang round the necks of their cattle,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"in order to find them again in the woods, announced our approach to a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"clearing, when we were yet a long way off; and we soon afterwards heard","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the stroke of the hatchet, hewing down the trees of the forest. As we","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"came nearer, traces of destruction marked the presence of civilized","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"man; the road was strewn with shattered boughs; trunks of trees, half","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consumed by fire, or cleft by the wedge, were still standing in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,track we were following. We continued to proceed till we reached a wood,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,in which all the trees seemed to have been suddenly struck dead; in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,height of summer their boughs were as leafless as in winter; and upon,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,closer examination we found that a deep circle had been cut round the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bark, which, by stopping the circulation of the sap, soon kills the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,tree. We were informed that this is commonly the first thing a pioneer,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,does; as he cannot in the first year cut down all the trees which cover,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"his new parcel of land, he sows Indian corn under their branches, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,puts the trees to death in order to prevent them from injuring his crop.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Beyond this field, at present imperfectly traced out, we suddenly came","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"upon the cabin of its owner, situated in the centre of a plot of ground","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"more carefully cultivated than the rest, but where man was still waging","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"unequal warfare with the forest; there the trees were cut down, but","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"their roots were not removed, and the trunks still encumbered the ground","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which they so recently shaded. Around these dry blocks, wheat, suckers","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of trees, and plants of every kind, grow and intertwine in all the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"luxuriance of wild, untutored nature. Amidst this vigorous and various","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"vegetation stands the house of the pioneer, or, as they call it, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"log house. Like the ground about it, this rustic dwelling bore marks of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"recent and hasty labor; its length seemed not to exceed thirty feet,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,its height fifteen; the walls as well as the roof were formed of rough,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"trunks of trees, between which a little moss and clay had been inserted","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to keep out the cold and rain.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""As night was coming on, we determined to ask the master of the log","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"house for a lodging. At the sound of our footsteps, the children who","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,were playing amongst the scattered branches sprang up and ran towards,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the house, as if they were frightened at the sight of man; whilst two","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"large dogs, almost wild, with ears erect and outstretched nose, came","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"growling out of their hut, to cover the retreat of their young masters.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The pioneer himself made his appearance at the door of his dwelling;,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he looked at us with a rapid and inquisitive glance, made a sign to the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"dogs to go into the house, and set them the example, without betraying","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,either curiosity or apprehension at our arrival.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""We entered the log house: the inside is quite unlike that of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the cottages of the peasantry of Europe: it contains more than is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"superfluous, less than is necessary. A single window with a muslin","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"blind; on a hearth of trodden clay an immense fire, which lights the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"whole structure; above the hearth a good rifle, a deer's skin, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,plumes of eagles' feathers; on the right hand of the chimney a map of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the United States, raised and shaken by the wind through the crannies in","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the wall; near the map, upon a shelf formed of a roughly hewn plank, a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"few volumes of books--a Bible, the six first books of Milton, and two of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"Shakespeare's plays; along the wall, trunks instead of closets; in the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"centre of the room a rude table, with legs of green wood, and with the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"bark still upon them, looking as if they grew out of the ground on which","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"they stood; but on this table a tea-pot of British ware, silver spoons,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"cracked tea-cups, and some newspapers.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""The master of this dwelling has the strong angular features and lank","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,limbs peculiar to the native of New England. It is evident that this man,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,was not born in the solitude in which we have met with him: his physical,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constitution suffices to show that his earlier years were spent in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the midst of civilized society, and that he belongs to that restless,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"calculating, and adventurous race of men, who do with the utmost","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"coolness things only to be accounted for by the ardor of the passions,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and who endure the life of savages for a time, in order to conquer and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,civilize the backwoods.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"""When the pioneer perceived that we were crossing his threshold, he came","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"to meet us and shake hands, as is their custom; but his face was quite","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,unmoved; he opened the conversation by inquiring what was going on in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the world; and when his curiosity was satisfied, he held his peace,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,as if he were tired by the noise and importunity of mankind. When we,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"questioned him in our turn, he gave us all the information we required;","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"he then attended sedulously, but without eagerness, to our personal","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"wants. Whilst he was engaged in providing thus kindly for us, how came","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,it that in spit of ourselves we felt our gratitude die upon our lips? It,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"is that our host whilst he performs the duties of hospitality, seems to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,be obeying an irksome necessity of his condition: he treats it as a duty,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imposed upon him by his situation, not as a pleasure. By the side of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the hearth sits a woman with a baby on her lap: she nods to us without,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"disturbing herself. Like the pioneer, this woman is in the prime of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"life; her appearance would seem superior to her condition, and her","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,apparel even betrays a lingering taste for dress; but her delicate,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"limbs appear shrunken, her features are drawn in, her eye is mild and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,melancholy; her whole physiognomy bears marks of a degree of religious,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"resignation, a deep quiet of all passions, and some sort of natural and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"tranquil firmness, ready to meet all the ills of life, without fearing","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"and without braving them. Her children cluster about her, full","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of health, turbulence, and energy: they are true children of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,wilderness; their mother watches them from time to time with mingled,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"melancholy and joy: to look at their strength and her languor, one might","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"imagine that the life she has given them has exhausted her own, and","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,still she regrets not what they have cost her. The house inhabited by,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,these emigrants has no internal partition or loft. In the one chamber,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of which it consists, the whole family is gathered for the night. The","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dwelling is itself a little world--an ark of civilization amidst an,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,The same thing has occurred in France. It is certain that during the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,But it is a vast error to suppose that there was anything degraded in,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the character of the French of that age. There might be some sort of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"servitude in France at that time, but assuredly there was no servile","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,spirit among the people. The writers of that age felt a species of,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,genuine enthusiasm in extolling the power of their king; and there was,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,no peasant so obscure in his hovel as not to take a pride in the glory,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of his sovereign, and to die cheerfully with the cry ""Vive le Roi!"" upon","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,his lips. These very same forms of loyalty are now odious to the French,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,"of danger: I am now about to point out another kind of peril, more rare","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"indeed, but far more formidable if it were ever to make its appearance.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"If the love of physical gratification and the taste for well-being,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which are naturally suggested to men by a state of equality, were to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"get entire possession of the mind of a democratic people, and to fill it","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"completely, the manners of the nation would become so totally opposed to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"military tastes, that perhaps even the army would eventually acquire","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"a love of peace, in spite of the peculiar interest which leads it to","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"desire war. Living in the midst of a state of general relaxation, the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"troops would ultimately think it better to rise without efforts, by","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the slow but commodious advancement of a peace establishment, than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,to purchase more rapid promotion at the cost of all the toils and,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"privations of the field. With these feelings, they would take up arms","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"without enthusiasm, and use them without energy; they would allow","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"themselves to be led to meet the foe, instead of marching to attack him.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It must not be supposed that this pacific state of the army would render,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"it adverse to revolutions; for revolutions, and especially military","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"revolutions, which are generally very rapid, are attended indeed with","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"great dangers, but not with protracted toil; they gratify ambition at","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"less cost than war; life only is at stake, and the men of democracies","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,care less for their lives than for their comforts. Nothing is more,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,dangerous for the freedom and the tranquillity of a people than an army,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"afraid of war, because, as such an army no longer seeks to maintain its","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"importance and its influence on the field of battle, it seeks to assert","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,them elsewhere. Thus it might happen that the men of whom a democratic,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,army consists should lose the interests of citizens without acquiring,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the virtues of soldiers; and that the army should cease to be fit for,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,war without ceasing to be turbulent. I shall here repeat what I have,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,said in the text: the remedy for these dangers is not to be found in the,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"army, but in the country: a democratic people which has preserved the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,manifest their greatness by simplifying the means they use; but it is,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,the purpose of God which is simple--his means are infinitely varied.,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,A democratic people is not only led by its own tastes to centralize,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"its government, but the passions of all the men by whom it is governed","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,constantly urge it in the same direction. It may easily be foreseen that,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,almost all the able and ambitious members of a democratic community will,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"labor without 2 ceasing to extend the powers of government, because they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,all hope at some time or other to wield those powers. It is a waste,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,of time to attempt to prove to them that extreme centralization may,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"be injurious to the State, since they are centralizing for their own","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,benefit. Amongst the public men of democracies there are hardly any but,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men of great disinterestedness or extreme mediocrity who seek to oppose,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the centralization of government: the former are scarce, the latter","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"I have often asked myself what would happen if, amidst the relaxation of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"democratic manners, and as a consequence of the restless spirit of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"army, a military government were ever to be founded amongst any of the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,nations of the present age. I think that even such a government would,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,not differ very much from the outline I have drawn in the chapter to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"which this note belongs, and that it would retain none of the fierce","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"characteristics of a military oligarchy. I am persuaded that, in such a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"case, a sort of fusion would take place between the habits of official","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,men and those of the military service. The administration would assume,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"something of a military character, and the army some of the usages of","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"the civil administration. The result would be a regular, clear,","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"exact, and absolute system of government; the people would become the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"reflection of the army, and the community be drilled like a garrison.","Tocqueville, Alexis de"

816,,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,It cannot be absolutely or generally affirmed that the greatest danger,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"of the present age is license or tyranny, anarchy or despotism. Both","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,are equally to be feared; and the one may as easily proceed as the other,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from the selfsame cause, namely, that ""general apathy,"" which is the","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"consequence of what I have termed ""individualism"": it is because this","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"apathy exists, that the executive government, having mustered a few","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"troops, is able to commit acts of oppression one day, and the next day a","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"party, which has mustered some thirty men in its ranks, can also commit","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,acts of oppression. Neither one nor the other can found anything to,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"last; and the causes which enable them to succeed easily, prevent them","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"from succeeding long: they rise because nothing opposes them, and they","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,sink because nothing supports them. The proper object therefore of our,"Tocqueville, Alexis de"
816,"most strenuous resistance, is far less either anarchy or despotism than","Tocqueville, Alexis de"
