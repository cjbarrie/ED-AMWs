## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Word frequency analysis Q1

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, and others
library(tidytext) # includes set of functions useful for manipulating text
library(ggthemes) # includes a set of themes to make your visualizations look nice!
library(readr) # more informative and easy way to import dat
```

```{r}
edbfdata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjbarrie/RDL-Ed/main/02-text-as-data/data/edbookfestall.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
edbfdata %>%
  mutate(obs=1) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(sum_events = sum(obs)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, sum_events)) +
  theme_tufte(base_family = "Helvetica") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, NA))
  
```
